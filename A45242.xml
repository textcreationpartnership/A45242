            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving a purpoſe (if the Lord will) to go through this Pſalm, I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat in a brief word to the Title of it. It's called <hi>A Song of Degrees,</hi> a Title that is common to fifteen Pſalms in this Book, from the 120 to the 134 <hi>incluſivè,</hi> and the importance of this Title is not eaſily condeſcended upon. <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers would from this make up fifteen Degrees of Vertues, each of them ſtill above another, whereby a Sinner breathes for Redemption by Chriſt, from a ſtare of Sin and Miſery, and aſcendeth to Heaven; but this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates them to ſtrain their Wits, and to put theſe Pſalms on a Rack, to find out the diſtinction of theſe Vertues, and therefore we ſhall leave it. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word rendred Degrees, leads us to ſomewhat more certain, yet not demonſtrative: That theſe Pſalms may be called Songs of Degrees, 1. Upon the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47356:6"/>
account of the way of ſinging them, the Voice in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them being raiſed to an high Key, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. where it is ſaid, the Levites ſtood up to praiſe the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a loud voice on high. It's the ſame word uſed here for Degrees. 2. There is a reaſon why theſe Pſalms were to be ſung with a loud Voice, a Song of Degrees may ſignifie a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Song, or a Song which in excellency ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts other Songs, and ſo the word is rendred when it is applyed to a man of excellency, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.17. Thou haſt regarded me according to a man of high degree, or a man of excellency, O Lord; and ſo theſe Pſalms may be called Songs of Degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are moſt excellent, for the ſweet, grave, and pithy Sentences they contain. 3. They may be called Songs of Degrees, upon the account of the place where theſe excellent Songs were to be ſung with an high voice. The Chaldee Paraphraſt ſays, upon the Degrees, or Stairs, whereby they went up to the Temple, or rather, whereby they went up to Mount Sion, the City of <hi>David;</hi> one of which fifteen Pſalms were to be ſung on every ſtep of theſe Stairs. And others will have them to be ſung in the ſeveral Manſions of the People that came from the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Captivity, for ſo we find the word rendred <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> 7.9. Theſe things I only name, and paſs them; and I might add one Conjecture more, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the affinity that is betwixt the word Degrees rendred, and the Original that ſignifies Burnt-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or Sacrifice. I incline to think, that theſe Songs were ſung by the Prieſts and Levites about the Altar, while they offered theſe Burnt-offerings, or Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47356:6"/>Having thus briefly ſpoken to the Title, there are other general Notes common to this with other Pſalms that might be inſiſted on, which I alſo paſs.</p>
            <p>For the Pen-man of the Pſalm, he is not deſign'd, nor is it needful to enquire who he was, ſince the Pſalm hath its authority from the Spirit of God, and not from Man. It is moſt like to be a Pſalm of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> or that <hi>David</hi> was the Pen-man, for theſe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Expreſſions, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. of this Pſalm, are uſed by him, <hi>Pſalms</hi> 54, 55, and 61. and many others.</p>
            <p>For the particular difficulty, to which this Pſalm relates, it is not needful to determine what it was. It may ſuffice us for taking up the ſcope of the Pſalm in general, that the Pſalmiſt is in a Diſtreſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Diſtreſs, ye will find him firſt Wreſtling, and then ſecondly, Victorious.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, His Wreſtling; ye ſhall take it up in three Branches, 1. Ye will find him wreſtling with plunging Difficulties and Perplexities, and theſe he expreſſeth under the name of <hi>Depths,</hi> and the way he takes to win out of them, is wreſtling by Prayer, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ye will find him wreſtling with the Senſe, and Conſcience of Guilt, putting back his Prayer, and Offering to cruſh his Hopes; and this he wreſtleth with by claiming to Pardon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ye will find him wreſtling with Delays to his Anſwer of Prayers, or Delays of the Outgate prayed for; and this he wreſtles with by Patience and Hope, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Again, in the laſt two Verſes, ye have him Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; for having gotten an Iſſue, he hoords it not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47356:7"/>
up, he does not conceal it, but, he brings it forth and improves it for the uſe of the People of God, whom he encourageth to hope in God, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Mercy, and Pardon, and plenteous Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; and on the account of his redeeming <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his Iniquities.</p>
            <p>So much for the Scope and Partition of the Pſalm.</p>
            <p>To return to the firſt two Verſes, upon which I may be the more brief, that I had occaſion to ſpeak to you before of the Troubles and Trials of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of Prayer, and Gods Anſwering Prayer; yet we ſhall not paſs this part, but we ſhall endeavour to gather ſome things uſeful from it.</p>
            <p>In this his Wreſtling then, take notice of theſe four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Ye have that that the Pſalmiſt is put to wreſtle with, which is expreſſed under the name of <hi>Depths.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The way of his wreſtling therewith, out of the depths he cryed, <hi>Out of the depths have I cried.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Ye have him reflecting on this his Practice, he takes a back-look of it, and he avows it before God, <hi>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Ye have the proſecution of this his Wreſtling, or his pleading for Audience in a new and doubled Suit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my ſupplications.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, the Depths out of which he cried: I cannot accord to underſtand it thus, that he prayed from the depths, or bottom of his Heart. So the Commentators I ſpoke of before, underſtand it of that degree of Vertue which is profound Prayer,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47356:7"/>
from the inward parts or bottom of the Heart. There is a truth in that I confeſs, that Prayer ſhould come from the bottom of the Heart, and in Prayer we ſhould write our Hearts on our Tongues; but I find it not a Scripture Phraſe, that People are ſaid to pray from the Heart, when they cry out of the Depths. Neither can I underſtand it of the Conſcience of Sin only, that (as ſome would underſtand it) he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a deep of Deſpair, upon the account of Guilt that he ſpeaks of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. and hath a promiſe of Redemption from <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. The word is Depths in the Plural Number, and therefore it is ſafeſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, more generally of plunging and ſinking Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, both outward Trouble and inward Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſulting thereon, and of the Conſcience of Guilt wakened up in Trouble that may come in under theſe Depths; and this interpretation agrees beſt with the current of Scripture, where we find the horrible Pit, the Miry Clay, Depths, Deep Waters, Water Floods, made uſe of to hold out great Troubles, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.2, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here touch upon one Obſervation, That not only the viſible Church, but even the truly Godly, may be brought under plunging Difficulties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, both inward and outward, to their great ſinking, or at leaſt their apparent ſinking. They may be, and are very often in the Depths, and put to their Prayers in the Depths, ſo it was with the Pſalmiſt here, and in theſe Pſalms formerly cited. And in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point,
<list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall firſt ſpeak a little to the Metaphor of Deep or Depths.</item>

                  <item>3. To a word of Uſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For the Metaphor of Deep or Depths, I ſhall ſhortly offer what I conceive is the Import thereof in theſe four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is a deep is a thing very dark, dig a Pit, and make it deep, the light of the day cannot penetrate into it; Thus the unintelligible myſteries of Seducers are called Depths, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. the depths of Satan ſpoken of. Thus alſo the wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God that men cannot indagate, are called Depths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.5. <hi>Thy thoughts are very deep,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God:</hi> and thus alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.6. a people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and of a hard language, whoſe whoſe words the people could not underſtand, are ſpoken of; in the Original it's a people of a deep Lip. Deepneſs then imports Darkneſs, Unintelligibleneſs, that which is Myſterious. And that this Notion is not ſtrained even in this caſe of Trouble, is clear from <hi>Hemans</hi> lament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.6. <hi>Thou haſt laid me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the loweſt pit, in darkneſs, in the deeps;</hi> where to be in Darkneſs, and in the Deeps, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt as Synonymous, or one and the ſame: And truly, this is ordinarily incident to the People of God, their deep Trials are in themſelves ſo dark, and in their effects ſo aſtoniſhing, that they are often at a ſtand, either to know what God ſays to them by them, and hence are theſe <hi>Wherefores,</hi> and <hi>Whys,</hi> as to this or that which is come upon them; as alſo in reference to their Duty, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47356:8"/>
his Diſtreſs, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Lord, we know not what to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2ly. This Metaphor of a Deep or Depths, as it imports that which is Dark and Unintelligible, ſo it imports that, out of which it is not eaſie to get up; caſt a Man upon the Ground he may eaſily get up, but caſt him in a deep Pit he can hardly get up out of it without help. Some Emblem we have of this in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 38. where he is put into the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where there was no Water, but Myre, and he ſunk in the Myre; <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> had a hard task to get him up: and the People of God their Troubles may be Depths upon that account, Refuge may fail them, no man caring for their Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4. All hope that they ſhall be ſaved taken away, (as it is ſaid by <hi>Paul</hi> in that Voyage, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.20.) all their expectations of an outgate may be cruſhed, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Why haſt thou ſmitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold, trouble;</hi> yea, all their endeavours to extricate themſelves out of Trouble may be fruſtrate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.18. <hi>When I would comfort my ſelf againſt ſorrow, my heart is faint in me:</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> 9.27, 28. <hi>If I ſay, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heavineſs, and comfort my ſelf: I am afraid of all my ſorrows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 3ly. This Metaphor of a Deep or Depths, Imports not only that which is dark and hard to get out of, but that which appears ruining; put a man into a deep Pit, if he get none to help him out of it, he muſt Starve and Ruine, as <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> ſaid to the King, they have put <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Dungeon, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47356:9"/>
he will die for hunger in the place where he is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.9. Put a man in a Pit where there is deep Water, he will drown, if he be not taken out. So the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, their Trouble may be ſuch, as not only all ground of hope of Out-gate may be taken away, but all hope of Iſſue may be accompanied with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent preſent Ruine. <hi>David</hi> is put to a humbling po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, when he is put to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.15. <hi>Let not the water floud overflow me, neither let the deep ſwallow me up, and let not the pit ſhut her mouth upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 4ly. The Metaphor of Depths in the Plural number, imports a plurality of them, a multitude of theſe depths, dark, hard, hopeleſs, ruining preſſures, tryſting all together on a Child of God, that his ſad lot may be like that of the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thou haſt called as in a ſolemn day, my terrors round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;</hi> There is a Convocation of them, one trouble ſeldom comes it alone upon the People of God; as one Wave uſes not to come its alone to beat upon the Shore, but Tryal upon Tryal, Wave upon Wave, one Depth calling upon another Depth, till their Tryal be perfected.</p>
            <p>More particularly, the plurality of theſe Depths, may be taken up in theſe ſteps, 1. Their outward Trouble may be attended with other viſible diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; for when a man is under trouble, then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly he is in contempt, <hi>Job</hi> 12.5. <hi>He that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſlip with his feet, is as a lamp deſpiſed,</hi> as a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſnuff in the thought of him that is at eaſe: Hence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. It is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame;</hi> The Croſs and Shame, the Croſs and Ignominy go hand in hand. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47356:9"/>
to be in Affliction, but thou muſt be content to be reproached, and counted a fool: yea, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth outward trouble and contempt go ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, but outward affliction and ſlighting from neareſt relations, which is a load above a burden, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.11. <hi>My lovers and friends ſtood aloof from my ſore, and my kinſmen ſtood afar off.</hi> Pſal. 88.8, and 18. <hi>Lover and friend haſt thou put far from me, and my acquaintance into darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. It comes to the Depths with the people of God upon this account. That great outward trouble readily w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>akens the Conſcience of Guilt, as we ſee of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, when they were put into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.41. <hi>They ſaid one to another, we are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear. Therefore is this diſtreſs come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</hi> Yea, outward trouble, and Conſcience of guilt under it wakened, may break the peace of the mind, and that adds to theſe depths. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> That is deep upon deep, trouble and guilt, trouble and broken mind turns to be the greateſt burden.</p>
            <p>And 3ly. It may come to Depths with the people of God on this account, that when once the mind is broken, there is no need of many real Croſſes; The imagination can no ſooner hatch an apprehenſion, but the broken Minde will make it a Croſs; and then ſo many apprehenſions, ſo many depths are created. And thus ye have ſome ſort of account of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this Metaphor, a <hi>Depth,</hi> or <hi>Depths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47356:10"/>I proceed to the ſecond thing, being to name a few Conſiderations for clearing how it comes to be thus with the people of God, That they are brought into theſe Depths, I ſhall name but a few, having been long in breaking in upon this purpoſe, which will ſave me a labour afterward.</p>
            <p>And 1. Take this Conſideration in general, The folly of the people of God puts them to this poſture, That is one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger; neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin.</hi> And v. 5. <hi>My wounds ſtink and are corrupt, becauſe of my fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Whatſoever there may be of a Tryal of Faith in their Trouble, Sin is the door at which their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, particularly their overwhelming Troubles, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in.</p>
            <p>But 2ly. Becauſe the people of God may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time through Mercy, be keeped from groſs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings; therefore conſider that even the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and habitual Faults of the people of God, will provoke him to put them in theſe Depths; I ſhall inſtance but in theſe two Faults. 1. The ordinary Fault of negligence in doing Duty, I do not ſay of neglecting Duty, cuſtom and Conſcience may keep them at Duty, but ordinary negligence in doing Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath need of a rouſing Douk in a Depth, to ſet them to their feet: If the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cryed out of the Depths, and the poor ſpeaks Supplications as he doth, <hi>v.</hi> 2. It intimats there is little crying, little humiliation in ordinary diligence, therefore he ſends to the Depths to put an edge upon folks diligence, and to teach them to ſay their Prayers in earneſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47356:10"/>A 2d. Fault in ordinar is, the neglect of ordinar needy dependence upon God in all things; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of going through the Wilderneſs <hi>leaning on the beloved,</hi> a ſmall fault as ye would think, but ſad in a Chriſtian life, to live in this neglect. Hence the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9. Saith, <hi>We were preſſed out of meaſure above ſtrength, inſomuch that we deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even of life, we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves.</hi> And for what end? To learn us dependence that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, <hi>but in God, who raiſeth the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 3. Whereas it might be thought that ſuch faults as theſe and groſſer, are paſſed in many others, I ſhall add, that the Lords near relation with his People, will not let them win away with their faults, win away who will, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities:</hi> Or as it is in the Original, <hi>I will viſit upon you your ſins.</hi> His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not want the Rod when their faults call for it, want who will.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider there is this to be looked upon, as a cauſe of his putting his people in the Depths, to wit, his purpoſes of love to his people, and his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances upon his people are ſo rich, that there is need of preparations by Tryal, and Afflictions to make them capable of them; for were they not put into the Depths, they could not be capable of them. Hence it is <hi>Paul's</hi> remark in the forecited place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5. God comforts us in all our Tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them, who are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47356:11"/>
comforted of God; <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt;</hi> we might not want theſe depths of tribulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without them, we could not be capable of the conſolations we receive from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And 5. To add no more, we may take notice of ſomewhat in the Saints tenderneſs above others, that occaſions theſe Depths: many folks may be under as great outward trouble, that are not ſo plunged and perplexed with it as they are: Many a man has been toſſed as <hi>David</hi> was by <hi>Saul,</hi> who have not ſo expreſt their reſentments as he did; How is this? The tender ſpiritedneſſe that is in the people of God, occaſions their trouble of mind, they ſee God in their afflictions, and they would fain ſee more of him, and of his mind, as to their duty, and this makes affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction take a deeper ſtamp, and impreſſion on them, and to draw Blood of them more than it doth on an unſubdued Spirit, who hath no mind of God, or Providence, but hath only the outward trouble to graple with. Thus we ſee how it comes to paſſe, that the people of God are put in the Depths.</p>
            <p>For the 3d. thing I propoſed to be ſpoken to, That is, the Uſe of the Doctrine, the whole Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be gathered from the two following <hi>Verſes,</hi> are Inſtructions how to improve ſuch a lot, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Uſes of the Point in hand. Therefore I ſhall content my ſelf to hint briefly at three general words here.</p>
            <p>And 1. From what hath been ſaid, ye would learn to be more jealous of a croſſeleſſe life, of a life without trouble and exerciſe; Why? It ſpeaks little
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47356:11"/>
of a ſoul thriving in the life of God: Take notice of that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.19. Spoken of the wicked, becauſe <hi>they have no changes, therefore they fear not God:</hi> And that ſpoken of <hi>Moab, Jer.</hi> 48.11. <hi>Moab hath been at eaſe from his youth, and hath ſettled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from veſſel to veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, neither hath he gone into captivity, therefore his taſte remained in him, and his ſent is not changed, and he rots on his lees.</hi> And as a croſſeſs life ſpeaks little thriving in the life of Grace, ſo it ſpeaks to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many, little of Gods love and care: There is a ſort of indignation kythed againſt ſinners, that they little notice, and wherein there is a ſnare, when they get leave to go on in ſin, and meet not with a Croſs, when a perſon will not deinze one that is going wrong with a reproof, it ſpeaks hatred: ſo that is a ſad word from God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be a reprover to them, for they are a rebellious houſe:</hi> and that word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, let him alone:</hi> That is a ſad diſpenſation; a douk to the hazard of drowning in the Depths is better company.</p>
            <p>And 2. From this ye would be Cautioned not to miſtake the ſad exerciſes of the people of God, whoſe lot in ordinar is outward troubles; they get ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtakes to keep, (and to mark it in the by) I wonder what a miſtake is befallen us, or rather a diſtraction is come upon us, that we ſhould ſtumble at the people of God their want of proſperity; look to the frame of the people of God, they are in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary broken folk. Others can bear their afflictions with a ſort of gallantry, they can drink them down,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47356:12"/>
rant them down. But they are broken with their affliction, as if they had no ſpirit at all to bear them; but I ſay, ye would not miſtake, for it is a token of Gods love and care who donks them in the Depths, to put them out of the Depths to cry unto him; and it is a more bleſſed poſture to be put out of the Depths to cry, than to be in a Palace with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Prayer: and therefore I can call it no better than a diſtraction to ſtumble at their want of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they are the folk that faint, and have no might, and yet they will lay by the young men, and the youths for all their ranting, becauſe they wait upon the Lord, <hi>they ſhall renew their ſtrength,</hi> Iſai. 40.29. This I ſpeak, not to foſter diſcouragement in any, but to caution them that are ready to ſtumble at the people of God their being in trouble, and broken in that condition.</p>
            <p>And a 3d. word of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall be, that every one that is in the Depths would try how they improve that lot, and this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is the Key to open the Door to the following purpoſe, which I ſhall not now break in upon, only remember, <hi>The Lord doth not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, nor grieve the children of men, to cruſh under his feet all the priſoners of the earth.</hi> Therefore there muſt be ſomething that in affliction, when we are in the Depths, he is calling us to, and which we would ply to in earneſt; and therefore we would take heed that the Bellows be not burnt, that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der do not melt in vain, and that we provoke not God to call us <hi>reprobat ſilver, whom he hath rejected,</hi> Jer. 6.29, 30.</p>

            <p>BEing ſo long detained in the morning in breaking in upon this Purpoſe, I ſhall now the more briefly come to that where I left.</p>
            <p>Ye have heard that in theſe two firſt <hi>Verſes,</hi> the diſtreſt <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was wreſtling with the difficulties, and ſinking perplexities in his condition, wherein we have an account of what he had to wreſtle with, <hi>The depths;</hi> the way of his wreſtling with theſe <hi>Depths,</hi> to wit, by Prayer, his reflecting on that exerciſe, and telling God, That <hi>he cried unto him out of the depths,</hi> and his Proſecution of it, or inſiſting and pleading with God in a new doubled ſuit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, the Depths wherewith he wreſtled, ſomewhat was ſpoken both for Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to a more general Application of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which I ſhall not now repeat.</p>
            <p>That which lyes before me in the ſecond place, is, the way of his wreſtling with theſe Depths, or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. Others had they been in the like exerciſe, might fret and repine, or they might labour to rant them out, or drink them down, ſo far as they were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47356:13"/>
able to rid themſelves of them, or they might cruſh under them; but he drives another Trade, his being in the Depths puts him to Prayer, and to fervency in Prayer, he not only intimats that out of the Depths he Prayed, but out of the Depths he cryed to God in Prayer, with that earneſtneſs, and fervour, that a drowning man, preſently going to ſink, cryes for relief, if any relief may be had. The general <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> which I take from this, is, That the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſult of ſinking and ſurchanging exerciſe in the Saints, is when it puts them to Prayer, and to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in Prayer, when being in the Depths, <hi>Out of the depths they cry unto God.</hi> This is the general Doctrine of trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that I may ſo far as is neceſſary lay the Point in broad-band before you, before I come to a word of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> I ſhall deduce the Importance of it in a few particulars.</p>
            <p>And 1. The <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> practice, who is content to be at exerciſe, doth import, That ſleeping and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a very unſuitable poſture, when the people of God are in the Depths, to be at any time without exerciſe is very dangerous; for as the Animal Life is ſtill in motion, ſo the Spiritual Life of a Chriſtian muſt ſtill be in exerciſe, ſo in particular, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exerciſe in a diſtreſs, and particularly to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prayer, is yet more dreadful; an idle man in a difficult lot, I can compare him to nothing, but to that drunken man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.34. That <hi>is as one that lyeth down in the midſt of the ſea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a maſt;</hi> he is a deſperat man, drunk
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47356:13"/>
with ſome Diſtemper that is not at exerciſe in the Depths. May I add, the idle man in the Depths, is readily the Guilty man that draws on the Storm and the Tempeſt; Hence we have a ſad Narration, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. where <hi>Jonah,</hi> a Godly man, fleeing from the preſence of the Lord, in the Storm, is down in the ſides of the Ship ſleeping, and one might think in the caſe he was in, he might have an unſound Sleep there, but the Text tells he was faſt aſleep; and ſhall I add, that's a ſad Poſture, <hi>verſ</hi> 6. when a Pagan Ship-maſter reproves a Prophet <hi>Jonah, what meaneſt thou, O ſleeper?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ariſe, and call upon thy God.</hi> That then is the firſt thing imported, that it is a dangerous thing to be ſleeping and idle in the Depths.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Pſalmiſt when he is in the Depths cryes out unto God, it imports, That kindly Saints, whenever they come in any Diſtreſs, have no refuge but God. It's with God and his Saints as it's with a Parent and a Child, in a Croud, as long as nothing ails the Child he will go beſide any body, but when he comes in a difficulty he will leave the reſt &amp; ſingle out his Parent to protect him; ſo I ſay it's with the Saints when any thing ails them, they have no refuge, no ſhift, no gate to go, but God. Would ye know the Character of a Child of God in Diſtreſs, ye have it in that fore-cited place, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>we have no might againſt this great company that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> This is the Scope of the moſt part of all the Pſalms. A Saint is no ſooner put to it, but he puts at God: a Croſs is no ſooner laid at his door,

but he tells, it's the wrong Door, and he goes and layes it at God's Door: the reaſon of this is double, partly the difficulties of the Children of God may be ſo great, that they are left allenarly upon God. It is with them as it was with that hypocritical king, when he ſaid to the Harlot, <hi>if the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> out of the Barn-floor, or out of the Wine-preſs. What will become of the Saints in many difficulties and hard caſes, if God ſtep not in; <hi>David</hi> looked to all Airts, and could find no relief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4, 5. <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me, refuge failed me, no man cared for my ſoul,</hi> what follows? <hi>I cried unto thee, O Lord, I ſaid, thou art my refuge:</hi> Kindly Saints muſt therefore look unto God in every Diſtreſs, partly becauſe whatever right means they have to make uſe of, they muſt either begin at God, or they will find they have followed a wrong method. <hi>Saul</hi> pretended to this, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> will come down upon me, and I have not made ſupplication unto the Lord, I muſt begin at God, ſaith he, and as <hi>Saul</hi> pretended to it, <hi>David</hi> really practiſed it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.7. whatever mind he had to purſue the <hi>Amalekites</hi> that had burnt <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A third thing imported in this, that the Pſalmiſt out of the Depths cryed unto God, is this, that there is no caſe of the Saints ſo deſperate, wherein Prayer is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47356:14"/>
uſeleſs, ye know what was that wicked Kings Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> and how many in Heart and Practice, in difficult Caſes ſay ſo? it is to little purpoſe to wait on God, to look to God. The Pſalmiſt here was of another temper, <hi>out of the Depths have I cried unto thee, Lord,</hi> ſaith he, he finds it to good purpoſe to cry unto God. So <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4. <hi>I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight;</hi> and he had as much to ſay for his being ſo as any other, the Waters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed him about, and went into his Soul. The Weeds were wrapped about his Head he went down to the bottoms of the Mountains. The Earth with her Bars were about him, yet even then he ſees not Prayer to be an uſeleſs Trade, wherefore he adds, <hi>yet will I look again to thy holy Temple.</hi> Prayer is to good purpoſe for all that, and no wonder, for there is no condition of the Saints ſo low, no Pit ſo deep, wherein they can be caught, but an humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant will from thence reach the Throne. A <hi>David</hi> buried quick in a Cave, a <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, find that Prayer can win up to God, and find audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for the high and lofty One, who hath the Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth for his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, hath an Eye alſo to them who are of a poor and of a Contrite Spirit, and trembleth at his Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1, 2. and he who humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven and in the Earth, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the poor out of the Duſt, and the needy out of the Dung-hill, and therefore no deſperate caſe of the people of God renders Prayer uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>But 4ly. That the Pſalmiſt out of the Depths cryes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47356:15"/>
unto God, it imports, That as there is no caſe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate as it renders Prayer uſeleſs, ſo it imports, that it is the property of the Saints, when they are right, that be Prayer hopeleſs, or not hopeleſs, they will not quite it, they will not give it over, put them in the Depths: It's a great encouragement to them, that they know it is to good purpoſe to Pray; but be it to purpoſe, or no purpoſe, they muſt be about it, they will not quite it, that place cited in <hi>Jonah</hi> proves it, let God caſt him out of his ſight, yet will he look to his holy Temple and Pray; ſhut him out at the Door, he will be in at the Door by Prayer. Tell him his difficulty is ſo great (as Temptation will be ready to ſay) that crying to God will do him no good, it's all a matter, to Prayer he muſt, he'll ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſink Praying, than be ſaved without it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.2. <hi>From the ends of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed.</hi> That's a notable word from a man in a deep Diſtreſs. What could a man imagine to be diſcouraging that he wanted? for his Caſe, he is as far from God as the ends of the earth; for his Heart, he is under Perplexity, his Heart is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed; and yet in that condition he will cry unto God, if ſo be he will lead him to the Rock that is higher than he, come of it what will he will Pray. And <hi>Heman</hi> is another notable inſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.13, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. he ſays, <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my ſoul? why hideſt thou thy face from me?</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>I am afflicted, and ready to die from my youth up, while I ſuffer thy terrors, I am diſtracted.</hi> I am put out of my Wits, my Wit gets a rack with thy ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee have I cryed, O
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47356:15"/>
Lord.</hi> No hopeleſneſs of my undertaking, no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I meet with could put me from crying to thee, <hi>and in the morning ſhall my prayer prevent thee;</hi> I will continue Praying, and, (to ſpeak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men) Thou ſhalt be ſoon up, but my Prayer ſhall be at thy Door to prevent thee; That then is the 4th thing imported here, not to be put from Prayer were our Caſe never ſo deſperate, nay not by the apprehenſion of drowning in the Depths, though at the next Bout we ſhould ſink to the bottom.</p>
            <p>But 5ly. That he ſays, <hi>Out of the depths have I cryed unto thee,</hi> it imports, that not only a Saint will not be put from Prayer, through the greatneſs of his Diſtreſs, but his Diſtreſs will put an edge upon Prayer, when he is moſt fervent, and made to cry out when he is in the Depths. And this word Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, expreſſing Prayer in the Text ſuffer me to Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate more particularly what it imports. I intend not to Speak of it as it is generally uſed in Scripture, but as it expreſſeth Prayer. And I ſhall here offer four or five Things to be looked to by them that would continue Praying in the Depths, or out of the Depths.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It imports a Mans being Affected with that which is his Caſe. The crying Man knows what ails him, when a Man Scricks or Cryes out, it is an evidence that he feels ſomewhat that Affects him much. Thus Crying is uſed upon the account of Grief, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.4. The marked Perſons are <hi>ſuch as ſigh and cry for all the abominations done in the midſt of the city.</hi> They cry out of ſad oppreſſion from Grief. And I find Crying in Prayer made us of, to ſignifie the fears of the Supplicant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. Our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47356:16"/>
bleſſed Lord is ſaid to offer up <hi>prayers and ſupplica-with ſtrong crying and tears, and he was heard in that he feared;</hi> Grief and fear importing the ſenſe of our Caſe, the ſource and fountain of our Cryes; a ſtupid Man that wots not how it's with himſelf, or the people of God, (who is like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that knew not that <hi>Egypt</hi> was deſtroyed) will not be a crying Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Crying imports, not only a ſenſe of ones Caſe, but an earneſt affection after that, which our cryes are employed about, it's not for Triffles that a Man cryes either to obtain or avoid them (at leaſt they are not Triffles in his opinion), it's given as an eſtimation of Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3. <hi>when a man cryes and lifts up his voice for it.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> cryes about that which he is affected with, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.2. <hi>my ſoul longeth, yea euen fainteth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> It's a token of raiſed Affections either to be rid of ſome imminent ill or hazard, or to attain ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good, that puts folk to Crying. A ſlighting of Trouble, (when a Man is like <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 7 9. <hi>gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knows it not</hi>) and a ſlighting of deſyrable Mercies, will not produce Crying for the one, or to avoid the other.</p>
            <p>But 3ly. This Crying imports, with ſenſe of need and earneſtneſs of Affection to be at the thing cryed for, a ſenſe of a diſtance. Wee uſe to cry to folk that are far off, and not within ordinar ſpeaking or rounding; and this follows well upon the former. When folks are put to Pray from the Depths, they will diſcern God at a diſtance from them, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a diſtance from God; it is another thing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47356:16"/>
when a man is in the Depths to be within ſpeaking terms with God as when he is at eaſe. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God while they are at eaſe are like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who thinks he hath no more ado, but go out and ſhake himſelf, and have God at his command; but the Man in the depths will not find ſuch an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come near God. He will not only be ſenſible of his natural diſtance, but of that diſtance he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the account of his Provocations, and ſo this Crying will take in ſenſe of Guilt to be confeſſed and mourned for before God. But this I ſhall leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will fall in upon the third and fourth Verſes following.</p>
            <p>A 4th Thing imported in this Crying is, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all that hath been ſaid a Saint ſhould cry out of the Depths, with Confidence in God, and of Relief from him, hence the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. It doth not prompt a Man to muter, or peep, or whiſper his Prayer to God; but to cry out with Confidence, Abba, Father. And whatever ſenſe we have of our need, or of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God, or of the Guilt hath drawn it on, Confidence is needfull to uſher in Prayer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Having ſuch an high prieſt, let us come boldy.</hi> The word in the Greek (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſignifies, let us come with <hi>an all-ſaying,</hi> with an open mouth, unto the Throne of Grace, with Confidence, <hi>that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, and find grace, to help in time of need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5ly and laſtly, This Crying out of the depths it imports, as the reſult of all that I have been ſpeaking to from it, a fervency of Affection; when folks are not only ſenſible of that they need, have an eſtimation of it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47356:17"/>
ſee their diſtance, come with ſome meaſure of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but an edge is put on their Affection, and they are fervent, and raiſed in Prayer for it; I do not mean that Prayer with the loudeſt Voice is ay the moſt fervent Prayer, when I think upon theſe Tones and Voices uſed by ſome in Prayer, I often mind that word, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.17. <hi>the words of wiſe men, are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</hi> It's not the Tone (though we ow the Voice to God) that makes fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to him. <hi>Moſes Exod.</hi> 14.15. prayed fervently, he cried to God when he ſpoke not a Word, and <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion.</hi> But my meaning is, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie, fervency, and inſtancy in Prayer from the Heart is required in them that talk and cry out of the Depths; ye talk of your ſaying of your Prayers, and among the Prayers in the world many of them are but ſaid Prayers, but when it comes to crying out of the Depths, your ſaid Prayers will not do the turn our bleſſed Lord was never ſuperficial in Prayer, yet <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. <hi>it's ſaid, being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly,</hi> there is a patern of Prayer out of the Depths, and I wiſh I ſaw a practical Commentar of that among you, which ye find <hi>Pſ.</hi> 107.12, 13. <hi>He brought down their heart with labour, they fell down, and there was none to help,</hi> (that's a poſture that would put many to Pray, and how far ye are from it, if ye were awake ye would diſcern) <hi>then they they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he ſaved them out of their diſtreſses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ye have heard the import of this <hi>crying out of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47356:17"/>
the depths unto God.</hi> As for the uſe of this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it affords divers, though all along the point is practical and applys it ſelf; I know not if I dare break in farther upon it, I ſuppoſe to ordinar hearers, all is poyſon that is ſpoken after the Glaſs; but ye ſhall take a few words from it, if this be the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſult of bleſſed trouble, to be put to <hi>crying to God out of the depths,</hi> then ye may ſee what a dreadful plague it is, that when people are caſt in the Depths, and the Spirit of Prayer is away, and there is no crying out of them to God, Shall I hold up to you a Glaſs to let you ſee your own foul Face in this matter. Read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.23. And I pray you forget <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and call this <hi>Scotland,</hi> and your ſelves Profeſſors in <hi>Scotland</hi> that are ſpoken to, <hi>Ye ſhall not mourn, nor weep, but ye ſhall pine away for your iniquities.</hi> O that is the Cop-ſtone of a peoples calamity, when it is ſaid to them, <hi>Ye ſhall pine away in your iniquities, and mourn, and roar one towards another.</hi> And will ye not get many ſuch up and down the Land, folks that are like wild beaſts in a net, ſtrugling with their Calamity, tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and talkers of their troubles, he blaming him, and he him, roaring for the ſad caſe themſelves and the Land are in, but where is their <hi>crying out of the depths to God?</hi> Who have added to the weight and meaſure of their Prayers for all that is come over them? Where will ye get a <hi>Daniel</hi> in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> that for three full weeks gave himſelf to Faſting and Prayer? Will ye have another Glaſs to ſee your foul ſpots in? Read <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law of Moſes, all this evill is come upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47356:18"/>
us, yet made we not our prayer to the Lord our God, that we ſhould turn from our iniquities and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thy truth;</hi> We feel well-enough all the evil that is on us, and that it is come as it is written in the Law, yet there is no Prayer to purpoſe. Will ye yet take another Glaſs? Then read <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the Lord tells what ſtroaks he had inflicted upon his people, every one of them heavier than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>I have done this, and this to you, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and ſtill the over-word is, <hi>yet ye have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto me.</hi> Many folks are blyth when things riſe to an height, and then they think God will be ſeen on the Mount, but they forget that continuing them in the Depths, is to ſet them to Prayer; it is the ſin of the Generation, that they look more to their Priviledges, than their Provocations, or ſo to their Priviledges, as they forget their Provocations; and lean ſo much weight on the righteouſneſs of their cauſe, as they forget that for which God hath put them in difficulties: I may ſay on this account, that fearers of God are ſelf-deſtroyers, <hi>O tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſhkelon, that God hath taken ſuch pains to put us to pray and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and yet we will do any thing, but Pray and Repent we will not. I ſee no iſſue in this, but to put off our Ornaments, and ſee what the Lord will do with us. And will ye yet take another word that may give folk a ſight of their foul Face? Even that Charge unjuſtly laid by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> againſt <hi>Job, chap:</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Which I doubt if we can lay ſo well from our door as he might, <hi>Thou caſteſt off fear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and reſtraineſt prayer before God.</hi> There is a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47356:18"/>
threefold reſtraint of Prayer before God in Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And I wiſh that one or all of them take not in the generality of the Generation we live in. 1. When folk that wont to Pray give it over. And what thouſands are there of this ſtamp in <hi>Scotland?</hi> and not a few in the Weſt Countrey. How many are there among us, that ſometimes have worſhipped God in ſecret, and now do not bow a knee to God? How many have worſhipped God in their Families, who now have left it off? And among you there are not a few ſuch, as we find by your ſhifting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, when you are asked therea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent, a thing that rather might be expected in the barbarous parts of the Land than among you, and is not Religion and Religious Duties much clipped where it had much place. A Prognoſtick of little good, when ſo few Families will be found having <hi>their poſts ſprinkled with the blood of ſprinkling.</hi> Now what ſhall I ſay of them that never Prayed, when ſo many have quit Prayer that once uſed it. O! I ſay it again, <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it not in Gath,</hi> &amp;c. That Apoſtaſie hath ſo far prevailed, that it hath driven many from the very form of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>A 2d. Reſtraint of Prayer is in them who have keeped up a Form, but alas they put me in mind of that word ſpoken of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Chariot Wheels, <hi>They drive heavily;</hi> There was a time when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in requeſt, and then folks got borrowed Wings that they Flew with, or Stilts in Religious Duties; but when a man comes in the Depths, he muſt have Divine Approbation, or theſe will not do his turn, or if he hold him by his Prayers, he will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47356:19"/>
be looked down upon and lightly eſteemed, and that he that was wont to ſoar in Prayer, will do much if he can creep on the Ground; but that clipping of Prayer, is a reſtraint of Prayer before God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add 3ly. That many reſtrains Prayer, that neither quites nor clips Prayer, of whom if ye judge by their frequent continuance, and the edge they have in Prayer, ye will find no difference betwixt what they are now, and what they were formerly, and ye will not eaſily know their reſtraining Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and yet they reſtrain it; for in ſtead of humble Supplications, their Prayers are made up of murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and quarrelling. And this way of Praying is much the way of them who are of the beſt ſtamp, that take out of their Prayers their quarrellings, complaints, glooms and frowns, ye will get little of the poor mans Supplications in their Prayers. Look to theſe things as Glaſſes, wherein ye may ſee your ſhort-comings and guilt, and I intreat the Lord to bleſs them to you for that end, and for your exciting to more fervency to Prayer. And remember when I preſs upon you <hi>crying out of the depths,</hi> that I preſs a peremptor Duty on you, and that every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Prayer while ye are in the Depths, diſpoſes you to Apoſtaſie, and is a ſtep to your ruine.</p>

The ſecond in order ſhall be this, if it be ſad to ſee the People of God in Diſtreſs and yet not Praying, it muſt be yet more ſad to ſee them in Diſtreſs, and in ſtead of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taking ſinful ſhifts to extricate themſelves out of the Depths, wherein they are. That the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which is ſent to call them to God, ſhould be ſo improved as if it had a Commiſſion to drive them from God. That if there be a ſinful ſhift to be had they will try that before they think on Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtoop to think on calling on God. It's a ſad Complaint of a wicked Generation that ye have, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vain have</hi> I <hi>ſmitten your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> it's to no purpoſe that I have taken pains upon them, for <hi>they received not correction,</hi> they will not ſtoop to it, they will not improve it as a Correction from God for Sin; and would ye know how ye ſhall ponder theſe Scriptures, which will lay before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47356:23"/>
you what I would ſay further on this Uſe. One is, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.13. When that People ſaw their wound, what did they with it? <hi>they went to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian, and ſent to king Jareb.</hi> They were ſo far from calling on God, that they took a ſinful ſhift, to bring them out of the preſent Trouble. Another is <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more,</hi> it's to no purpoſe, for ſmite you as I will, <hi>ye will revolt more and more,</hi> to ſmite you, that's the high gate, if ye were ill before, to make you worſe. If you was far from God, to drive you further from him. A third Scripture is that ſpoken of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28.22. Who in the time of his Diſtreſs, in ſtead of turning to God, did treſpaſs yet more and more againſt the Lord, <hi>this is that king Ahaz.</hi> who in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs would not Pray, but would worſhip the gods of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> who he pretended had helped them againſt him: I ſhall ſay no more to this Uſe, but look to it; it's a dreadful thing when Trouble makes folk worſe, than they were before Trouble came on them; and I ſhall add, that a People taken pains upon by Trouble, and not Crying out of the Depths unto God, they are in the neareſt capacity of any, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Treſpaſs under it; a Prayerleſs Trouble will be a ſingularly plagued Trouble, to them that are under it.</p>
            <p>But a third word of Uſe, ſhall be by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a Cavillation or Objection. It may be ſaid, there may be a great deal of din made of Crying and Turning to God in Trouble, but are there not many who never owne God in their Trouble, and who if they can have a ſinful ſhift take them to it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47356:24"/>
and yet theſe come through when Praying folk ſtick in the Mire. To prevent this Cavlllation or Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſay, take this word of Uſe, that if it be a duty to cry out of the Depths to God, then it is a plague for folks to be brought out of Trouble, and not ſent to God by Prayer, when they are brought through their Trouble, and never ſent to God to make ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of their turning to him. <hi>Job.</hi> 36.13. When <hi>Elihu</hi> is preſſing upon folk, the right improving of Affliction, he adds, <hi>but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath, they cry not when he bindeth them;</hi> they heap up wrath, why? they cry not when he bindeth them. If we will believe the Spirit of God ſpeaking in Scripture, a perſon not Crying to God, when God binds him, he heaps up wrath againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And I ſhall deſire ſuch as ſwatter through their Trouble miſkenning God, to conſider theſe three things. 1. That it muſt be God that gives them any Delivery, though they do not acknowledge him in it, nor for it, and conſequently it is not given in Love, but in Wrath: there may be much Wrath in Delivery from Trouble in a ſad way, as well as in ſending Wrath upon a wicked perſon by Trouble. 2. Conſider, that any Delivery thou meets with, who art not Crying to God in thy Trouble, it's but a ſnare to thee; thou loves not Prayer in order to an iſſue, and God in his holy Providence lets that outgate out of Trouble come as a ſnare in thy way, that thou ſeeſt not the neceſſity of Prayer unto him; and it's the ſadeſt of Snares to be put off Prayers in miſter. To be like theſe ſpoken of, <hi>Job.</hi> 21.15. Who are brought in, ſaying, <hi>what is the Almighty, that we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47356:24"/>
ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have, if we ſhould pray unto him?</hi> we get our turn done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and therefore we need not Pray. 3. Such as in Trouble reſtrain Prayer, would conſider that all that is owing them is but friſted, it is not forgiven, thou gets a proof of Gods Riches, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and Long-ſuffering, and that ſhould lead thee to Repentance, but it doth it not, and thou conſiders not, <hi>that after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, thou treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of his righteous judgment, Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. I can give it no better nor appoſite term than what ye have, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.23. <hi>The Lord was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them, and had compaſſion on them, and had reſpect to them, becauſe of his covenant with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob, and would not deſtroy them, nor cast them out of his preſence.</hi> As yet, there was a reſerve in that Mercy, the Judgment was to come upon them, but not yet; look to it then ye who in your Trouble, get your turn done without God, that what is friſted is not forgiven.</p>
            <p>But the fourth and laſt word of Uſe I ſhall give you from this Note, ſhall be this. Ye that are put to Pray in Trouble, I intreat you look that ye be at Crying with it. I ſhall not reſume what I ſaid upon this the laſt day, as that ye would be Affected with your Caſe, that ye would be in earneſt, that ye would have a ſenſe of your diſtance, get confidence to come ſpeed, and withall a raiſed fervency of affection, after that you cry for to God, only let your Prayers look like your need of God, and the greatneſs of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; Ponder that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. A word which I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47356:25"/>
have often cited to you, <hi>This people draws near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but they have removed their heart far from me.</hi> Mark the Phraſe, he doth not ſay, they draw near me with their Mouth, while their Heart is far from me, but <hi>they have removed their heart far from me,</hi> which imports, that there is no more effectual mean of eſtranging a Soul from God, than a Trade of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Worſhip, it is an active removing of the Heart from God. I ſhall only add this word, that as I have ſpoken to them that in trouble neglect the Duty of Prayer, that their Out-gates ſpeak no good to them, but Wrath, and a Snare; ſo I would have Folks cautious in judging of their livelineſs, or ſeriouſneſs in Prayer by their Out-gates out of Trouble. Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that place, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There ye will find a Praying People and ſeemingly ſerious, they ſeek God and return, and enquire early after him, they remember he is their Rock and Redeemeer, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but he being full of compaſſion, forgave their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and deſtroyed them not.</hi> There is a People ſpared and delivered when they Cryed to God, when the Lord approves not of their Prayer. We muſt therefore get another Teſtimony, to prove our not being For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in Prayer, than Out-gate or Delivery out of Trouble. A proof of Love and Compaſſion in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery may be Gods call to us to mourn over our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, in Prayer, and for our other Sins, which he came over to do us good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47356:25"/>But I proceed to a third Head in this firſt part of the Words, and that is his reflecting on his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and his avowing it before God, O Lord (ſaith he) <hi>I have cryed unto thee,</hi> he looks back and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what he hath been doing in Diſtreſs, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath been Wreſtling, he layes it out and avows it before God. The general which I mark from it ſhall be this, <hi>That reflection on our ſelves, and on our way what we have done, or are doing is very neceſſar in all them that would approve themſelves to God.</hi> Such was the Pſalmiſts practice here, he looks back and finds the Depths put him to Crying, and is able to give an account of it. There is a twofold Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God calls for from the children of Men. One is a Reflection upon their Caſe what it is, that they be not ſtupid and ſenſleſs without Conſideration what their lot is. Ye have that quarreled, <hi>Iſa</hi> 52.25. <hi>He poured out upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battel; and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart;</hi> and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Strangers have devoured his ſtrength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not.</hi> That argues dreadful Stupidity and Senſleſneſs, when Folks are in a low condition, and do not conſider, and do not mind it, do not lay it to Heart. But there is another Reflection beſide that of our Caſe called for, and that is a Reflection on our Carriage under our Caſe; when we have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our Caſe, we would Reflect what we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a caſe, or under ſuch Lots as Providence makes our Portion. This is it the Pſalmiſt expreſſes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47356:26"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Commune with your own heart upon your bed;</hi> and it is that the Lord preſſes upon his People, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1 5. <hi>Now therefore conſider your ways,</hi> ſet your Heart on your ways. This Reflection Self-ſearching or Examination is moſt neceſſary in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar; a Man wors not where he is, nor what he is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion, if he neglect this part of it; if he be a Stranger to Self-Examination, he is a Stranger to his Progreſs or Decay in Religion, his Convictions and Challenges are Confuſed, and without Fruit. His Prayers cannot be but Confuſed, if he Pray any, it muſt be at Random. Only the Man that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in Examination can diſtinctly lay out his Caſe before God; and this Examination, as it's neceſſar in ordinar, ſo ſpecially in Trouble. If a Man in Diſtreſs neglect Examination, he may be carried head-long in Stupidity, in Paſſion, Quarreling, Fretting, or other Sinful Improvements of his Trouble, and as it is, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. He may do all this, and <hi>not conſider that he is doing evil</hi> he is quite out, and knows not of it; and ye have an Idea of that Man that is not in Reflection on his Caſe and Carriage under it in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.9. I <hi>hearkned and heard, but they ſpake not aright; no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done? every one turneth to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into battel.</hi> He goes Hand over Head, like a wild Horſe in his Courſe, why? he Reflects not upon his Carriage under Trouble.</p>
            <p>Not to dip on this, let me in ſhort from it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Self-Examination to you, eſpecially in Trouble, if ye would haunt it in ordinary, it would be more eaſy to you in a Diſtreſs; if ye be in ordinar reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47356:26"/>
upon your Weakneſſes, and examining your Wants, upon your Predominants, your Temptations, what are your Suits that are moſt binding on you? and your Succeſs? ye will the more readily (as we uſe to ſpeak) hit the Nail upon the Head, when ye come to Pray. And theſe your Prayers that come from Self-Examination, though they be leſs busked, they will be to better purpoſe, than when a Man with all the Oratory he can reach, vents his Gift in in Prayer; and particularly look what ye are doing as to this Duty, when ye come in any Diſtreſs, I gave you before ſome Scriptures that ſpeaks to them that neglect Prayer in Trouble. Now let me mind you of ſome words, whereby to try your Self Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in Trouble, one is <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41. <hi>if then their uncircumciſed hearts be humbled, and they then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the puniſhment of their iniquity;</hi> that were a bleſſed reflection that did produce this effect; but on the contrary, look that your reflection be not like that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.10. <hi>They are not humbled even unto this day.</hi> And like that <hi>Dan</hi> 9.9. <hi>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer unto the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, &amp; underſtand thy truth, and Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I would have purged thee, and thou was not purged, thou ſhalt not not be purged from thy filthineſs any more, until I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi> Ye would make uſe of theſe, and the like Scriptures, in your Reflection upon your way, and what ye are doing when ye are in the Depths. And further when ye are Reflecting upon your Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age under Trouble, ye had need of tenderneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Paſſion will give you a blind gueſs of your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47356:27"/>
ſelves, or of your Caſe or Carriage under it, when the Lord ſays to <hi>Jonah.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Does thou well to be angry, Jonah?</hi> the paſſionate Man ſays, <hi>I do well to be angry, even unto death;</hi> they that would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on their Caſe and Carriage under Trouble, would ſeek a compoſed frame of Spirit, and tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from God.</p>
            <p>But to come a little nearer unto this Reflection, taking the words in the by paſt time, <hi>Lord, I have cryed unto thee.</hi> They will import, that God had keeped him long at that Trade, and to this purpoſe we have a word, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.3. After that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the two firſt Verſes, that <hi>the waters are come in into his ſoul, that he ſinks in deep myre, where there is no ſtanding, that he was come into deep waters, where the floods did overflow him;</hi> he adds v. 3. <hi>I am weary of my crying, my throat is dried, mine eyes fail while I wait for my God,</hi> and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.82. <hi>mine eyes fail for thy word, when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> but this I may paſs, becauſe it will occurr <hi>v.</hi> 2.5. and 6. and becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſt things preſent in the by paſt time, becauſe their Verbs have not a preſent time. That which I ſhall ſpeak to from the words conſidered as a Reflecting on his bygone wreſtling, I reduce to theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he owns it as a thing that hath been, and is his Practiſe, to be crying to God out of the Depths.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe Folks may be ready to ſay, what is he the better of that? he hath not got an anſwer of his Prayers. I ſhall add this, that his Supplication out of the Depths affords him a Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, ye may take up the Note thus, that no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47356:27"/>
diſtreſs, no diſpenſation of providence warrands the Saints to caſt all that they have been doing as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound: though he be put to the deeps, he owns it that he is a cryer out of the deeps unto God. <hi>Out of the deeps have I cryed unto thee, O Lord.</hi> Thus the Church owns her integrity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Covenant; Our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way, though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of dragons,</hi> &amp;c. Smite us as thou will, we avow it that we are in thy way. And <hi>Job</hi> 13.5. <hi>Though he ſhould ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him, I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mine own ways before him,</hi> that is, my integrity. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 27, 5. <hi>I will not remove mine integrity from me:</hi> And ſo <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88, 15. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee have I cryed, O Lord, and in the morning ſhall my prayer prevent thee;</hi> do what thou will with me, I avow it that I have been at Prayer, and I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it. It is true, men would be humble in this matter of avowing their integrity, they would mainly be ſtudying their wants, and ſhort-comings, and the iniquity of their holy things; and it is true alſo, that when they are in the deeps of diſtreſs, and theſe tryſts them with Gods ſeeming not to notice them, but rather his anger ſmoaks againſt their Prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. It ſhould humble them yet more, and make them ſearch their imperfections in their beſt things; and it's alſo true, that the people of God in reflecting on their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Prayers, ſhould be far from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome humour in hypocrites, <hi>Iſai,</hi> 58.3. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47356:28"/>
have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not?</hi> &amp;c. As read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y the greateſt Hypocrites are the greateſt quarreders, when they want ſucceſs, yet all this notwithſtanding, it is our duty to ſtick by what is right in our way, while we are in the deeps: Men muſt not be baffled out of their integrity, becauſe they are under the Croſs, and have the wind in their teeth, they muſt not caſt their Prayers, becauſe God holds them in the deeps; it's no ſmall part of the Saints ſervice to ſtick by, and to avow their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that white Robes are allowed them, though their Prayers be not anſwered, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10, 11. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have ſilly ſpirits, who when they meet with a torrent of Croſſe providences, are baffled from avowing their integrity, and ly by, and dare not face the ſtorm upon that account.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the 2d Obſervation, It may be ſaid, what the matter of folks owning their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and crying out of the deeps, when they are not heard, but ly in the deeps for all that? I Anſwer in the ſecond Note. That what ever be the ſeeming ſucceſs of the Saints in the deeps, their ſupplications out of the deeps affords them a teſtimony. It's good news that the Pſalmiſt dare owne this, Lord, thou haſt caſt me in the deeps, but I have cryed to thee out of the deeps; It's a good Cordial to <hi>Heman,</hi> while he is in the deeps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.13. <hi>But unto thee have I cryed, O Lord, and in the morning ſhall my prayer prevent thee, Lord, why caſts thou off my ſoul?</hi> &amp;c. And if ye ask what riches can be in this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that we have cryed, and continue crying out of the deeps? I ſhall paſs it with the time in three
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47356:28"/>
words; 1. It's a token of a bleſt and ſanctified trouble, when folks are led to God by trouble, that's better than many out-gates, they are <hi>bleſt whom when God chaſtens, he teacheth out of his Law, Pſal.</hi> 94.12. And the firſt Leſſon God teacheth them, when he puts them in trouble, is to go to himſelf with the trouble. It is a remarkable word that <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Mother had. <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.23. <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering;</hi> ſo many ſuch folk ſay, if God had a mind to deſtroy them, he would not turn them in to himſelf in their trouble. There is more of the love of God inclining thy heart to cry to him out of the deeps, than in many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, there is a rich bleſſing in it, 2. This teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is rich, becauſe it warrands a man having done his duty, to caſt his burden on God and in nothing to be anxious. It's no wonder a man be cruſht with his trouble before he go to God with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but when he goes to him, he hath a warrand to caſt all his cares and fears on him, he hath <hi>Hannah's</hi> allowance, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Who being a woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit, went and poured out her heart before the Lord</hi> in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and left her anxiety on God, <hi>and came away with her countenance no more ſad.</hi> This is a practice that few of us attain unto, we ſeem to carry our cares to God in Prayer, but we bring them back with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, rather augmented than diminiſhed. 3. This teſtimony is rich, becauſe it aſſures the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant, whatever be his preſent ſucceſs, (whereof if the Lord will, we may ſpeak a word in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon) that he ſhall come ſpeed, crying out of the deeps, ſhall be heard; for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.18. <hi>The needy ſhall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47356:29"/>
not always be forgotten, the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever. Iſrael</hi> might think God had forgotten them, when they were ſo long in the deeps in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſighed and cryed to him, by reaſon of their bondage, but at length God heard their groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and remembred his Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Exod.</hi> 2.24. And ye know that word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.19. <hi>I have not ſaid to the ſeed of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, ſeek ye me in vain.</hi> He never ſaid it in any age, and he will not begin at us.</p>
            <p>Take this word of Uſe from it, labour to have this Teſtimony, to be crying out of the deeps, ſo as ye may avow and owne it; and to be improving it, labour to read love and a bleſſing in it, to caſt all your burdens on God by ſo doing, and confidently to expect ye ſhall ſee the end of the Lord. In a word, labour to find that by grace, in ſo doing, that trouble cannot take from you, to find a delivery in trouble, rather than a delivery out of it, to find that which is of more worth, than many deliveries, and infinitly of more worth than any delivery can be without it.</p>

            <p>FROM the firſt Branch of the Pſalmiſt's wreſtling and exerciſe, I have ſpoken to theſe theſe three, 1. To the deeps, wherewith he was put to wreſtle. 2. To his cryes whereby he wreſtles with theſe deeps. 3. To his reflecting upon this his practice, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it before God, as that which afforded him a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that out of the deeps he had cryed unto God.</p>
            <p>Now there remains the proſecution of this wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and his pleading for audience, in a new and doubled ſuit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Lord, hear my voice,</hi> &amp;c. While he pleads for the hearing of his voice; the meaning is not, that the voice is all that ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God; I confeſs we ſhould give him the voice when we can give him no more, and lament that we have no more to give him but the voice; but the voice that the Pſalmiſt would have heard here, is the voice of his crying out of the deeps, the voice of his moſt fervent and earneſt ſupplication, ye ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

here are doubled (as frequently in the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi>) to evidence, how earneſt he was in this ſuit, that he is not complementing with God, when he is ſeeking acceſs and audience to his Prayers. The expreſſions alſo are Metaphorical, and borrowed from the carriage of a Parent to a Child, and upon the matter his ſuit is this, Lord, notice me when I pray, as the Parent will notice the diſtreſſed Childs cry when he is like to ruine, <hi>and let thine ears be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the voice of my ſupplications,</hi> that goes a little further; that as a Parent knowing a Child to be in hazard, he will liſten and hearken attentively if he can hear him cry and notice and ponder that cry, and what he cryes for; ſo he pleads with God, that he would be waiting on and attentive, to ſee and hear if a cry ſhould come from him, and that he would affectionatly ponder and notice it when he hears it: For this hearing of Prayer, it hath ſo frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred before, that I ſhall paſs it, and the whole Verſe in three words, that I may come to other things in the Pſalm, which I mainly deſigned to ſpeak unto, when I broke in upon it.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that ye ſhall mark here is, that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified affliction not only puts the Saints to Prayer, but alſo that they cannot reſt upon the work wrought of Prayer, but they muſt have an anſwer to their Prayer; <hi>I have cryed out of the deeps unto thee, O Lord, Lord, hear my voice;</hi> he muſt be heard. The ſenſible man, when God bleſſes the diſtreſs he is in, to put him to Prayer, he doth not reſt there, but preſſes for a hearing, for an anſwer to his Prayer; and two things evidence the truth of this, one is, a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47356:30"/>
ſenſible man in trouble will find it hard to be out of ſpeaking terms with God, hard to have any thing of <hi>Saul</hi>'s caſe in his lot, that when he ſought God in his diſtreſs, <hi>he would not anſwer him, neither by dreams, nor by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, nor by Prophets,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.6. When folk come into trouble, if they have any ſenſe or feeling of their condition, they will know of what worth an intercourſe with Heaven is, and what it is to have a door open to them from thence, when all doors are ſhut upon them from earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot reſt on Prayer, but will preſs for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Another is, That as it will be hard with ſenſible Saints to be denyed audience, ſo they need and prize the thing they ſeek: It's not for a faſhion, or for a complement, or for a trifle, that they cry out of the deeps; but their life (if I may ſo word it) is lying in pledge of what they would be at; there is nothing betwixt them and ruine, but the anſwer of their Prayers, and therefore they cannot reſt without it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> It leaves a ſad conviction on them, who if they come the length to worſhip God, and pray to him, their task is done, they have prayed, and that's enough; I confeſs, by Prayer and Supplications, folks may caſt many events over upon God, but yet they would bide at Prayer, till they get an account of that which they are ſeeking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> It's an evidence that folks have little preſſed upon their hearts the neceſſity of that they are ſeeking, when they look not up for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47356:31"/>
And hence alſo they have evidence, that (as it is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.) Though they name the name of Chriſt, it is not their care to depart from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that they may not bring a reproach upon Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor obſtruct the ſucceſs of their Prayer with God; this is the great fault of formal Profeſſors, they will keep up a form or faſhion of Prayer, but they little know, or labour to know what it is to Trafficque with Heaven by their Prayer.</p>
            <p>But a ſecond word ſhall be this, that Supplicants in diſtreſs may be exerciſed with delaying of the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwers of their Prayers; <hi>I have cryed out of the deeps unto thee, O Lord,</hi> but he dare not ſay, that God hath heard him. Therefore he is put to pray over again, <hi>Lord, hear my voice,</hi> The ſenſe of non-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation may haunt a Supplicant, and he may find the thing that he is ſeeking is not granted; yea, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants may not only be exerciſed with delays, and ſeeming denyals, as <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.20. <hi>I cry unto thee, and thou doſt not hear me, I ſtand up, and thou regardeſt me not.</hi> And <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44. The Church complains, <hi>Thou hast covered thy ſelf with a cloud, that our prayers ſhould not paſs thorow.</hi> Not only I ſay, may Supplicants be exerciſed with delays and ſeeming denyals, but with very ſad diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the back of their Prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry?</hi> or wilt thou ſmoak <hi>againſt the Prayers of thy people?</hi> They may have ſmoaking wrath meeting their prayers, and that for a long time, in ſtead of a comfortable anſwer, which is ſad at all times, but eſpecially in trouble. For clearing what folk ſhould make of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47356:31"/>
this, I ſhall only name ſome things that I ſpoke more largely to at another occaſion. 1. Though the Pſalmiſt hath a teſtimony that he is crying indeed to God, when yet he is not heard, we ſhould look when we are not heard, that there be nothing wrong in the ſupplication, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.22. Chriſt ſaith to ſome, <hi>Ye know not what ye ask:</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> roved upon the Mount, it was ſo with him. There may be a defect in the matter, manner, or end of the ſupplication. <hi>James</hi> (4.3.) ſays, <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, to conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> 2. When our ſupplications are not anſwered, we would look that there be not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wrong in the Supplicant; folks may be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when there is ſtanding unrepented of guilt, that meets them in a ſtrait, (as I may hint on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe) there may be ſome controverſie, that God hath with the perſon, which till it be done away, he will not hear needy and preſſing ſuits; and though the controverſie may be done away, as to ſtanding guilt, there may be an habitual ill frame, which the Lord would rectifie by keeping the Supplicant at his Bar. They may in ordinary be formal and carnal, and have an edge in trouble, and he will not let them ſtick there, and therefore will keep them at the back of the door, till they learn to walk with God in ordinary. And 3ly. when the Supplication is right, and Supplicants in a right frame, there would be the exerciſe of Faith, that God will not deny eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuit that he doth not anſwer, or delays to anſwer. The exerciſe of Faith, that he is but trying us, if we will go to another door, when he delays to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47356:32"/>
yea, this is the exerciſe of Faith, to believe that many ſuits are not unanſwered, which we think are not anſwered: God anſwers the ſuits of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants, when he accepts and approves of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. Though he grant not the thing they ſeek, he anſwers, when <hi>He ſtrengthens</hi> the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant <hi>with ſtrength in his ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 138.3. And there are anſwers of Faith, which ſhould be read from the Word, and made uſe of. I have the more briefly paſſed from this, that this purpoſe occurred before on another Text, and from it take two brief words, and I ſhall leave it. One is, That Supplicants cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in diſtreſs, and not coming ſpeed, they would be invited to the reflection that I ſpoke to in the forenoon, to ſee how all is, that there be nothing wrong in the Supplication, nor in the Supplicant, that there be no action of guilt, no controverſie that muſt be removed, before a comfortable anſwer come; that ſhould be a ſearching Lot, when the Bill of the needy Supplicant is lying at the Footſtool, without an anſwer. And another is, if even Supplicants may be humbled and exerciſed with delays, ere they get an anſwer to their Prayers, what will become of them that pray none at all? <hi>If this be done in the green tree, what will become of the dry?</hi> (as Chriſt ſays, ſpeaking of his ſufferings, compared with the calamity that was to come upon the Jews.)</p>
            <p>But I proceed to a third word, and that is to clear what it is that God requires of needy and honeſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants, when they are put to cry, and cry again in Prayer, for an anſwer, and it is not given. Beſide what I ſpoke before of reflection, I ſhall ſhortly from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47356:32"/>
the Text point at three things to be done, or that God calls for. And 1. In this caſe, the Lord is calling folk to pray on, <hi>I have called to thee, O Lord,</hi> there is Prayer, <hi>Lord, hear my voice,</hi> there is a new Prayer; <hi>Let thine ears be attentive to my ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> there is a third ſuit: Although thy belly ſhould cleave to the earth while thou lyes in the duſt, thou muſt continue in ſupplication, although thine eyes ſhould fail in waiting for God, and his ſalvation, yet pray on, there is nothing formidable in a Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants condition, ſo long as he is not driven from Gods Footſtool, but he prays on. 2. Another direction is, that repulſes or delays ſhould promove humility in Supplications, and Supplicants. It's here ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he puts up, when he pleads for audience: Now the poor uſes ſupplications, ſupplications are the Beggers, are the Dyvours Language; many Supplicants when they have cryed long, and are not heard, may be in peril to fret, to quarrel, to repine, to bark; but that's a wrong method to come ſpeed with God in Prayer, thou ought to be the more humble, the longer thou art delayed, thou ought to creep the nearer the duſt, and come in among the poor that ſpeak ſupplications. And a third direction ſhall be from the Phraſe and Metaphor in the Text, as I explained it in the entry, that is, that there be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that the Lord hath an affectionat ear to liſten unto, and hear the cry of humble Supplicants. This is imported in the very terms of the Prayer put up to God, as an affectionat Parent, ready to notice the cry of his Child, when he is in hazard, and crys for help; and this is a needful direction, when the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47356:33"/>
is held at the door, that beſide diligence and humility, he entertain Faith, that bods well of God; Faith, that when God was ſeeming to deſtroy <hi>Job,</hi> made him ſay, <hi>Theſe things haſt thou hid in thine heart, I know that this is with thee,</hi> Job 10.13. I know thou haſt a kindneſs for <hi>Job,</hi> though thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear terrible to me; ſo muſt Faith reckon, when anſwers to Prayer are delayed. I know he will do me good, though I ſeem not to be noticed.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the third and fourth Verſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have the ſecond Branch of the Pſalmiſt's wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that is a wreſtling with guilt, that might hinder audience, and to give you a general view of theſe two Verſes, ye ſhall take this Branch of his wreſtling in theſe three: 1. Ye have a very ſenſible and humble acknowledgment of the deſert of ſin, in the moſt godly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhould ſtand?</hi> That is, iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſo hainous a thing, that if thou wilt mark them as a ſevere Judge, and according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works proceed with men, none would be juſtified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ye have the Pſalmiſt's relief being thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in Gods pardoning mercy, on which he lays hold, in the beginning of the 4. <hi>verſ. But there is forgivenneſs with thee,</hi>—</p>
            <p n="3">3. This pardoning mercy in God, is amplified from the end he hath before him in letting it forth, <hi>That thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> that is, not only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, becauſe thou art a merciful and pardoning God in Chriſt, men have acceſs to worſhip and ſerve thee, who otherwiſe art a conſuming fire; but in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47356:33"/>
particular, thy pardoning mercy will excite men to fear and worſhip, ſo good a God that freely pardons iniquity, under the weight and burden of which they could not ſtand.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, his ſenſible and humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the deſert of ſin in the moſt godly, I may touch it the more curſorily now, becauſe it will fall in, when afterward I come to ſpeak of the right way of applying pardoning mercy, where I ſhall take a view of this Verſe, as it points out the right method of obtaining pardon, and the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the pardoned ſinner, calling upon God in trouble; what I would ſay now upon it, ye ſhall take up in theſe three.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Ye have the ſenſe of ſin and guilt, joyned with the ſenſe of trouble.</item>
               <item>2. Ye have the ſenſe of guilt meeting a godly man in the teeth, when he is ſent to God by Prayer in trouble.</item>
               <item>3. Ye have guilt meeting him with a terrible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that if God marked it, he nor none is able to ſtand.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, I ſhall give it to you in this brief Obſervation, That in right exerciſe, the ſenſe of ſin and guilt ſhould go along with the ſenſe of diſtreſs and trouble; the Pſalmiſt reſts not on his being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he was in the deeps, but he is alſo lying under the ſenſe of ſin and guilt; a man that hath the meer ſenſe of trouble without the ſenſe of ſin, he is no more than a beaſt that will feel a ſmart, and ſo it is a bruitiſh thing to be houling under the ſenſe of trouble, without the ſenſe of ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47356:34"/>
have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they houled upon their beds.</hi> They houled for their trouble, but they called not ſincerely unto me. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>They return, but not to the moſt high, they are like a deceitful bowe:</hi> And hence <hi>Micah</hi> (6.9.) <hi>The Lords voice calls unto the City, hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it:</hi> There muſt be a hearing of the Appointer of the Rod, as well as the Rod it ſelf. To evince the truth of this point, I ſhall ſhortly hint at ſome conſequences that readily follows the ſenſe of trouble, without the ſenſe of ſin: Not to ſtand upon this that readily they choiſe a new ſin to an outgate, <hi>Job</hi> 26.1. <hi>This haſt thou choſen rather than affliction.</hi> I ſhall name theſe three: 1. Where the ſenſe of trouble is without the ſenſe of ſin, folks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to win ſoon out of it; There are readily a world of conceity folk, that think they will win ſoon and eaſily out of their trouble; <hi>Judah</hi> found the weight of trouble, but not the weight of ſin, and when they were going to captivity, they were filled with dreams of outgate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.4. <hi>They ſaid, he ſhall not ſee our laſt end.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. They ſaid, <hi>becauſe I am innocent, ſurely his anger ſhall turn from me.</hi> And when they were brought very low, that deluſion did not leave them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.15. They ſay, <hi>Get ye far from the Lord, unto us is the land given in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.24. <hi>Theſe of them that did inhabite the waſtes, ſaid, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many, the land is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us for inheritance.</hi> Whence it is clear, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded confidence, is one of the wofull fruits of the ſenſe of trouble, without ſenſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:47356:34"/>A 2d is, woful bitterneſs, and carnal diſtempers of Spirit, if not when the trouble comes on, becauſe they truſt to be ſoon delivered from it, yet when it continues long, How find ye that people? <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.19. and the parallel places, who are brought in, ſaying, <hi>Wherefore hath the Lord our God done all theſe things unto us?</hi> What's our iniquity? And what's our ſin? And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51, 20. Ye may take up the temper of ſuch a people, <hi>Thy ſons have fainted, they ly at the head of all the ſtreets, as a wild bull in a net; they are full of the fury of the Lord, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of thy God.</hi> Ye will not tame a wild Beaſt, by putting him in a Net, but mad him the more; and ſo are they who continue long under the ſenſe of trouble, without the ſenſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>And a 3d Conſequence is, a woful iſſue, when ever delivery out of trouble comes to folk in ſuch a poſture; and I find in this iſſue theſe two to concur, one is, their hungry ſtarved luſts, meeting with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, do ſurfeit upon them; as the peilled Jews, when they came from the Captivity, and had not quit their covetouſneſs, they no ſooner came back, but they eat up one another: And another is, when ſuch folk are delivered out of the ſtrait wherein they were, their delivery ordinarily hath the plague of God with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When that people cryed for fleſh, <hi>He rained fleſh upon them as duſt, and feathered fowl as the ſand of the ſea; they were filled, he gave them their deſire; but while the meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them, and ſlew the fatteſt of them, and ſmote down the choſen men of Iſrael.</hi> This in ſhort would put folk
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47356:35"/>
to it in ſhoring times, to ſee what they are moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with, whether with trouble, or with ſin? If ye be going with your hands on your loyns, what ails you? What affects you moſt? Sin or trouble? Provocation, or trouble, the fruit of your provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Mark it, there is much exerciſe in ſad times, when it is not about ſin, and the fruit of that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe will be found wind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.18. <hi>We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind.</hi> Senſe of ſin over-weighing ſenſe of trouble, were a bleſt mean to cure our trouble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin;</hi> when he makes all the ſtones of the Altar as Chalk ſtones, that are beaten aſunder, the Groves and Images ſhall not ſtand up.</p>
            <p>But the 2d Note I propoſed to be ſpoken to was, That ſenſe of guilt meets him in the teeth, when he comes to God; The Obſervation is, that guilt will readily meet the people of God, in their approaches to him under trouble: when he is crying to God out of the deeps, and is earneſt for audience, God's marking of iniquity ſtares him in the face, to put ſome ſtop and demurr to his acceſs and audience, and the iſſue he would have been at.</p>
            <p>If time would ſuffer, I would deduce this point in theſe four. 1. A tender ſoul is known by many heart-ſmitings for ſin, which <hi>David</hi> was well acquaint with in the Wilderneſs, when <hi>he cut off the lap of Sauls garment,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. A very innocent thing to vindicat his own integrity, yet his heart ſmote him; a heart-ſmiting for ſin was no dainty to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47356:35"/>
him then; I confeſs, when men are at eaſe, and are not in a tender frame, they may give way to groſs ſins, and their heart not ſmite them. What a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is <hi>David</hi> in, when he is at eaſe and ſecure? What a wide throat hath he to ſwallow down Adultery, and Murder, and to betray a part of his Army? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>The ſword devours one as well as another,</hi> (ſaith he,) it's the fortune (as we call it) and the chance of War, let it not trouble thee. That was not like <hi>David</hi> when he was tender; but however the general holds true, that heart-ſmiting from ſenſe of ſin is a moſt infallible ſign and evidence of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and nearneſs to God. O but the skin of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience near God is thin! A little thing will draw blood of it: And as upon the one hand, ye would try your nearneſs to God by this, ſo upon the other hand, ye would look upon it as poor gallantry to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſin, without a heart ſmiting you for it. There is a generation of men, who are called ſtrong ſpirits, gallant men, and wherein doth their ſtrength of ſpirit, and gallantry ly? In contemning the Law of God, in treading upon his Authority, in defying God, they can commit all wickedneſs, and ſleep in a ſound skin, and never be troubled with it; theſe are our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, but the day will come, when that will be found poor gallantry, and that he is the brave ſpirit, that knows what heart-ſmiting for ſin is, and hath tenderneſs in his walk.</p>
            <p>There is in the 2d place this in particular, that when Saints go to God, then their guilt readily meets them, although they have little ſenſe of guilt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, yet when they approach to God in earneſt, their ſin will muſter up before them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:47356:36"/>3. Although in ordinary Addreſſes, they may be little ſenſible of ſin, yet when a ſtrait comes, and they are ſent to God, then their ſin will find them out, though they can walk in ordinary, and be little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with guilt, yet in a diſtreſs it croſs-necks them.</p>
            <p>And 4ly, Although wicked men do not readily meet with guilt, becauſe they are plagued with ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, yet their guilt will meet with them, and they ſhall find it marked by God, as if when they came to God in ordinary, they came to proclaim their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Branches of the Point, which now I cannot inſiſt on, to deduce at large, only if ye have to do with God, and be in earneſt, beware of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented guilt, the longer it be in meeting with you, it will be the ſadder when you and it meet, and the longer it be that ye lay it not to heart to repent of it, and turn from it, it will be the more ſad. God bleſs what ye have heard.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47356:36"/>
with guilt, which might ſtop his audience and ſucceſs; and (as ye heard) he doth 1. make a ſenſible confeſſion of the miſdeſerving of ſin, that if God ſhould mark it as a ſevere Judge, none ſhould be juſtified; none ſhould be able to ſtand. 2. Ye have his relief and refuge, being thus humbled in the pardoning mercy of God, upon which he lays hold in the beginning of the 4.

            <p>From the firſt of theſe, I ſpake to a general Note, That the ſenſe of trouble, and the exerciſe about it, ſhould be attended with the ſenſe of ſin, and exerciſe about ſin; for the Pſalmiſt here is exerciſed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with both; while he is crying out of the deeps, he is lying under the ſenſe of ſin. I confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, and marked ſome ſad conſequences that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſenſe of trouble, without ſenſe of ſin. I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo at a ſecond general Obſervation but was cut ſhort by the time, in ſpeaking to it, that is, That godly men will very readily find guilt meeting them, when they are ſent to God in trouble; for when the Pſalmiſt here is made to cry to God out of the deeps, iniquities interpoſe and ſtare him in the face: This Point I did deduce in theſe four, three of which I

That it is the duty of godly perſons, and their Character, to be acquainted with heart-ſmitings for ſin; what ever <hi>David</hi> was while at eaſe, and in proſperity, in digeſting Adultery and Murder, yet when he is in trouble, and in the Wilderneſs, and cut off the lap of <hi>Saul's</hi> Garment, his heart ſmote him. Frequent heart-ſmitings for ſin, is a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of nearneſs to God, and it's a pitiful and woful Gallantry, to go on in ſin, and digeſt ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſentment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Branch of the Note was this, That what-ever tenderneſs and ſmiting of heart for ſin, the Saints have in ordinary, yet readily it will meet them, when they come to Ordinances and Duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, eſpecially to be ſerious with God in Prayer; for here when the Pſalmiſt is at Prayer, guilt ſteps in, ſin Muſters, and God's marking of iniquity ſignified much to him; a tender heart when it is in the view of God, and hath its eye upon him, ſhould, and will be moſt obſervant of its failings. <hi>David</hi> dare not think of coming to God, till he ſee what account he gets of doing away his guilt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.6, 7. <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſs thine Altar, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe guilt will offer to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct audience and ſucceſs, in what the Supplicant would be at. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.36, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> would conſult God about going down after the Philiſtines, there is a fault found committed, <hi>Jonathan</hi> had taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Honey, and the guilt meets him, he was not anſwered: And to ſay no more of this, I ſhall only
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47356:37"/>
mark two words from it, and proceed. One is, That it ſhould and will be a motive to a tender walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to walk tenderly, circumſpectly, &amp; accuratly, when he conſiders, that he hath God to go unto, he will think with himſelf, how circumſpectly ought I to walk thorow the day, that have God to go to at night? How can I, or dare I looſe Reins to this or that, and offer to bow a knee to God? Will not my untenderneſs in this or that ſtep of my way, ſtare me in the face, when I look God in the face? If folks knew what it were to have Communion with God, and what influence ſin hath to obſtruct it, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved either to quite their Prayers, or ſtudy a more tender and holy walk. Another word ſhall be this, if there be any of a looſe and untender walk, ſlipping Buckles through the day, and they hear no news of it; at their Prayers, their guilt doth not interpoſe, and raiſe a Cloud betwixt God and them; ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would look to it, that there be not a lie in their right hand, that they be not under a deluſion, and feeding upon aſhes; if they were tender, they would no ſooner go to God, but they would ſay, I remember my faults this day, I have ſinned, and now my guilt ſtares me in the face.</p>
            <p>But the 3d Branch of the Doctrine is, That what ever be Saints tenderneſs in ordinary, or what-ever ills they may digeſt in eaſe, a great diſtreſs or trouble, will readily bring guilt to mind, and obſtruct their acceſs, when they are ſent to God, when they are made to cry out of the deeps, God's marking of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will ſay ſomething to them. For diſtreſs take notice of that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where ye
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47356:38"/>
have the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, taking with their guilt; it was upwards of twenty years ſince they ſold him, but when they come in diſtreſs, it is as recent as if it had been juſt now committed: <hi>They ſaid one to another, we are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi> Folks would have thought that upwards of 20 years guilt, might have been buried; and no doubt the men in that time had prayed often, but in a diſtreſs it's recent. And for going to God in trouble, we have an inſtance of guilt meeting folk, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.10. where the people in trouble come and cry unto God, and take with their ſin; But what anſwer get they? <hi>I delivered you (ſaith the Lord) from ſuch and ſuch enemies, when ye cryed unto me, but ye have forſaken me, and ſerved other gods, wherefore I will deliver you no more, go and cry unto the gods which ye have choſen, let them deliver you in the time of your trouble.</hi> Mark alſo that word of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking to the two Tribes and the half Tribe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.33. when he feared they might cheat their brethren, and deſert them, he tells them, <hi>If they ſhould do ſo, they ſhould ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord.</hi> There is news (might ſome ſtout ſtomacks among them ſay) but he adds, <hi>and be ſure your ſin will find you out.</hi> A man may uſe many ways to ſhift guilt, but it will not do with him, his ſin will find him out. Ponder that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.5. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould I fear in the days of evil, when the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my heels ſhall compaſs me about.</hi> Iniquity is like a Slouth Hound, that rambles here and there,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47356:38"/>
following the ſcent of the Prey, and an ignorant ſpectator wonders what he means, but he follows the Prey, and will not give over till he find it; ſin unrepented of will ſooner or later meet, and the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they be of meeting, it will be to the ſinners great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſadvantage. May I add further, when ſin meets the ſinner in trouble, an infirmity will paſs for an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, (as here the Pſalmiſt calls ſin) and will not ſeem ſo ſmall, as when it was committed, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the trouble came on; yea further, pardoned guilt that ſeemed to be buried, and done away, theſe green Graves may open, and that guilt may waken upon new emergents. Hence <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. ſays, <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.7. <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Remember not the ſins of my youth, nor my tranſgreſſions.</hi> Therefore ye that meet not with ſin in ordinary, ſee what ye can do to hold off trouble, and ſins meeting you in trouble; ye now can go on in ſin, and have your diverſions to put away the thoughts of it, and live ſtrangers to your ſelves, and your own condition; but trouble will croſs-neck you, and ye will find (as the word is <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.) <hi>That ſin is lying at the door,</hi> and will meet you.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall add a fourth Branch of the Doctrine, and then come to the main Doctrine which lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my hand. I have ſpoken of guilts meeting with the godly; Now what ſhall be ſaid of guilts meeting with wicked men? I ſhall ſay two words to this, and leave the Note. One is, let a wicked man live never ſo long without minding his guilt, let him have Ordinances, and keep up a form of Worſhip; This
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47356:39"/>
is to be adverted to, that the wicked man never comes into God's preſence to worſhip or pray to him, but his iniquity is marked, as if he had made a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſin. Ponder that Proceſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. and the foregoing Verſes, <hi>Bring no more vain oblations (ſaith the Lord) incenſe is an abomination to me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, and calling of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, I cannot away with, it is iniquity, even the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meeting; your new Moons, and your appointed feasts, my ſoul hateth: and when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</hi> Thou that dare come before God, without the ſenſe of thy guilt, God may look upon thee as proclaiming thy guilt. And another word to the wicked ſhall be this, that, when ever a day of diſtreſs and trouble meets them, though all of them will not be honoured with repentance, and pardoning mercy, they ſhall find, that they have made a very ſad bargain. Take it in that word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thy own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back-ſlidings ſhall reprove thee; know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I leave this Note, and come to the third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that is, that when Guilt and Conſcience meets, ſin will be otherways looked upon, than men ordinarily do; or if ye will have it more diſtinctly, take it thus; That the right ſenſe of ſin, will lead the ſenſible man to ſee that in ſin, that none, even the moſt Godly can ſtand before God, if God deal with them in ſtrict Juſtice, according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47356:39"/>
of Works. That is the very marrow of this Verſe, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhould ſtand?</hi> No man, no not a godly man, nor any other can ſtand. And although I may (if the Lord will) have this purpoſe to reſume when I come to ſpeak of pardon, and the application of pardon from the next Verſe following; yet this being an important truth, a verity of great weight, ye will bear with me, though I dip a little more in it than is my ordinary: What I would ſay on it, I ſhall from the Text deduce to you in ſix particulars, which I hope ſhall give a hint of what at the firſt view is more material in the words.</p>
            <p>And 1. Take notice of ſomething ſuppoſed here, that is, God's marking of iniquity, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity,</hi> where he makes a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's marking iniquity; not that any Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or doubt is to be made of Gods Omniſcience, that he ſees and knows all things, and particularly mens ſins, he hath an exact knowledge of them all, as when one marks things moſt narrowly; Neither is there any ſuppoſition or queſtion to be made of Gods ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin in the godly, ſo as to be diſpleaſed at it. <hi>Antinomians</hi> would be at this, they would have no ſin ſeen in them, but the ſcope of this Pſalm evinces the contrary: God notices the godly mans ſin as well as others, till he flee to pardoning mercy through a Mediator; And <hi>David,</hi> though a godly man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Against thee, thee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight.</hi> But the meaning of this, the Lord's marking of iniquity, may be taken from the parallel place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47356:40"/>
where it is thus expreſſed, <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy ſervant;</hi> That's the marking of iniquity ſpoken of, or ſupponed in the Text; and in ſhort, the importance of the Phraſe is, Gods marking of ſin according to the Covenant of Works, and in the rules of ſtrict Juſtice, and without looking on the ſinner as in a Surety. In this reſpect, Gods mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of iniquity being accompanied with abſolute ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, perfect purity, and juſtice, he cannot away with it, nor with the ſinner becauſe of it, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Thou art not a God that haſt pleaſure in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with thee. The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi> And <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity.</hi> God thus marking iniquity according to the rules of ſtrict Juſtice, and without looking on the ſinner as in a Cautioner, cannot away with it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will puniſh it, <hi>Job</hi> 11.11. <hi>He ſeeth wickedneſs, alſo will he not conſider it?</hi> In order to puniſhment, for ſo that Phraſe is Expounded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Thou haſt ſeen it, for thou beholdeſt miſchief and ſpite, to requite it with thine hand.</hi> And it is <hi>Jehu</hi>'s remark of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Surely I have ſeen yeſterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his ſons, (ſaith the Lord) and I will requite thee in this plat, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The marking of iniquity this way, is to men dreadful, and ye will find in Scripture, that it is a dreadful ſight of trouble that ſome gets, when it repreſents God thus as marking ſin, to purſue and puniſh it, as in that poor widow, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.18. <hi>O thou man of God</hi> (ſaith ſhe to the Prophet) <hi>art
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47356:40"/>
thou come unto me to call my ſin to remembrance, and to ſlay my Son?</hi> That was a ſad ſight of trouble, and of ſin in trouble; and <hi>Moſes</hi> in that tragical buſineſs in the Wilderneſs, when calamities are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thick upon that people, it is a ſad ſight of them that he gets, when they ſpeak, Gods marking of ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90 8. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi> Thy inflicting of calamity tells us, that thou art marking iniquity. So much for the firſt thing ſuppoſed here, God's marking iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, here ſomewhat propoſed. That if God mark iniquity as a ſevere Judge, according to the ſtrict rules of Juſtice, to puniſh it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly do puniſh it, the guilty man cannot ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. This Phraſe is equivalent to that Phraſe in the parallel place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>If God enter into judgment with men, no man living can be justified in his ſight.</hi> And a ſinners inability to ſtand before God, is a Phraſe frequently made uſe of, to point out the dreadful deſert of ſin, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight.</hi> Ezra 9.15. <hi>We are before thee in our treſpaſſes, for we cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this.</hi> Pſal. 1.5. <hi>The ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the judgment, nor ſinners in the congregation of the righteous.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.7. <hi>Thou even thou art to be feared, and who may ſtand in thy ſight, when once thou art angry.</hi> Rev. 6.16, 17. <hi>The great day of the Lambs wrath is come, and who is able to ſtand?</hi> And to this alſo that Phraſe may allude, which the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> have, when ſo many are ſtricken dead, for their curious looking
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47356:41"/>
into the Ark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Who is able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this holy Lord God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may explain this a little more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall take it up with an eye to humane Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Courts among men in theſe four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas a man when he is to compear before a Court, he may ſtand in Judgment, and be <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> (as we uſe to ſpeak) Why? He is able to plead innocent, and he may come off being found ſo: but here, a man in whom is iniquity, cannot ſtand. The ſinner cannot plead ſinleſs, as it is, <hi>Job</hi> 9.2, 3. <hi>I know it is ſo of a truth, but how ſhould man be juſt with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> There is no pleading ſinleſs before his Barr. And in particular, this is to be applyed to ſecret ſins; there is no concealing of the moſt ſecret ſins, when God marks them. <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.20. <hi>The way of the adulterous woman is ſuch, that ſhe eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith, I have done no wickedneſs;</hi> but God noticeth it. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi</hi> abuſes his Maſters name, and goes to Fiſh from <hi>Naaman</hi> Silver and Raiment, and comes and ſtands before his Maſter, and ſays, <hi>He went no whither;</hi> but ſays <hi>Eliſha, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned again from his Chariot to meet thee?</hi> 2 King. 5.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men may convey their ſins ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloſely, and hide their contrivances from men, but they conſider not they have an Omniſcient God for their Party, whoſe Spirit is infinitly above the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to follow them in all their ſecret pranks. And that's it, that <hi>Moſes</hi> lays to heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.8.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47356:41"/>
               <hi>Thou haſt ſet our ſins before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In humane Courts, when a man is made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though he cannot ſtand to plead himſelf inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or free of the Debt he is charged with, yet he may ſtand, becauſe he is able to pay the Debt, though the Sentence paſs againſt him; but ſo cannot a man ſtand before God, when he ſhall mark iniquity, for he hath nothing to ſatisfie Juſtice for his fault, and hence the man ſenſible of ſin, will not look upon the debt of ſin as a trifling matter, as a matter to be dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with. Thoſe Queſtions <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Act. 2.37. <hi>What ſhall we do? Job</hi> 7.20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> They import, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of guilt will not be a ſufficient exoneration in the ſenſible mans account. They import alſo, that it is a concerning Caſe or Queſtion, how to be rid of guilt? And further they import, a ſubmitting to any terms that can be exacted, if they be in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners power to perform; And here I confeſs, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites when they are told of their fault, will offer to make a mends, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and how my ſelf before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings? with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of rams? or ten thouſand rivers of oyl?</hi> (more than he could have offered, though it had been accepted) <hi>Shall I give my firſt-born for my tranſgreſſion? the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> O! but the ſenſible man will find, that he can make no mends. That there is no Fend againſt guilt,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47356:42"/>
but Pardon, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men? And why doſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In humane Courts, when a man is made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though he be Sentenced for a Debt he is unable to pay, or judg'd guilty of a Crime, he can undergo the puniſhment reſolutely, and in that reſpect he may ſtand in Judgment; but here the ſinner cannot ſtand before God marking iniquity, that is, under the burden of the deſert of ſin, or the deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, without ſuccumbing; a man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any puniſhment inflicted by an humane Court, and his natural courage may ſupport him under all that man can inflict, but who can ſtand under ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wrath? Who can ſtand before a ſin-revenging God, and not ſuccumb? Who can endure the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments of Hell, and not be everlaſtingly broken? So there is no ſtanding for the guilty ſinner before God, but he muſt ſuccumb and break.</p>
            <p>But 4. as amongſt men, any ingenuous perſon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for Debt, and not being able to pay, or being looked upon as a monſtruous Criminal by the Judge, it will make him bluſh, that he cannot ſtand before the Judge with confidence: So here, (which ſhould be the reſult of the former) when ſinners are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſin, and are convinced they cannot ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, conſidered as out of a Cautioner, it may be matter of bluſhing and horrour to them, and ſhould be ſo, when they find they cannot ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God marking iniquity. This was the poſture of the poor Publican, who <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. <hi>ſtanding a far
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47356:42"/>
off, would not ſo much as lift up his eyes to Heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner;</hi> he had not the confidence to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but he cryed out for pardon. And this was the practice of <hi>Ezra,</hi> when he went to God in behalf of the people, that had corrupted themſelves, after Gods kindneſs towards them, and correcting of them for their ſins, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am aſhamed, and bluſh, to lift up my face to thee, O my God, for our iniquities are increaſed over our head, and our treſpaſſes are grown up to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This, I ſay, ſhould be the reſult of all the reſt, and would be a token for good, that God would find out the way how the ſinner might ſtand before him in Judgment: If a ſinner being convinced he is guilty, and that he cannot undergo the puniſhment, without cruſhing, would bluſh and be aſhamed, if we were delivered from our brazen Brow, and Whores Fore-head, that we could not look up to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhame and bluſhing, there were hope of pardon through a Surety.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the firſt two, of the ſix particulars, I propoſed to be ſpoken to, for finding out what is ſaid in the Text: There are three or four moe to be battered out, with the application of the whole, which I leave till the Afternoon. The Lord bleſs what ye have been hearing.</p>

            <p>I Am (as ye may remember) from this Verſe, making out a very weighty and ſad point o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> truth, that there is no ſtanding before God, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquities in ſtrict Juſtice, according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; and for finding out what is ſaid in this Text, for bottoming and clearing of this point, I propoſed to remark ſix particulars from the Text, two of which I have ſpoken to in the Forenoon, to wit, that which is ſupponed here, that God is a marker of iniquity, and what it imports: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that which is propoſed on this ſuppoſition, That if God ſhould mark iniquity, as was explained, men, even the moſt godly men, could not ſtand, where ſomewhat was ſaid to the importance of that Phraſe.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed in Explication of the Point from the Text, (for to that I confine my ſelf) in other four particulars; The firſt, and third in order ſhall be this: That this aſſertion, that men cannot ſtand before God marking iniquity, is of infallible verity, a moſt certain and infallible truth, it is not a Bug-Bear to afright Children, but the infallible truth of God. This is hinted at in the Text, partly in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47356:43"/>
Pſalmiſt his propoſing the matter to God, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> He propoſes it to God, who knows this matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other, and who is Supream Judge in the matter, without whoſe determination, a Decreet in our own favours will ſignifie nothing at all; it imports, O Lord, let men dream what they will of their ſtanding, thou knoweſt, that none can ſtand, if thou ſhalt mark iniquity, to puniſh it; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the infallible verity of this aſſertion, may be gathered from the way of propoſing it, and that is, by way of Queſtion, <hi>Who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Which Queſtion, is a very peremptory denyal of the thing queſtioned, for ſo the like Queſtion is reſolved, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</hi> Yea, the propoſing of it by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Doth import a defyance to any to attempt it, or to ſucceed in their attempt, and indignation at the preſumption of any, that ſhould dream of ſtanding before God, marking iniquity.</p>
            <p>But in the fourth place, as this aſſertion is of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible verity, ſo it is of univerſal verity. This is held out in the Queſtion, for the Queſtion is, <hi>Who ſhall ſtand?</hi> That is as the parallel Queſtion is anſwered, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>None at all,</hi> good or bad, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity, none ſhould ſtand;</hi> for the Pſalmiſt here, a godly man, is taking in himſelf with others, as a man that could not ſtand himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon. And ſo the Phraſe is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi> The beſt of men that are come of <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary generation, ſhall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47356:44"/>
not be juſtified, if thou mark iniquity. Hence in Scripture it is clear, that Saintſhip conſiſts not in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs, but in ſincerity, for, for Original guilt in that, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Not one; and for a mans endeavours after he is brought in to God, and is wreſtling with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to have theſe purged out, ſays <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſinneth not;</hi> but as it is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2 <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> Thus ye ſee that Saintſhip doth not conſiſt in ſinleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in ſincerity; neither doth Saintſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, in the Saints their ſins not deſerving condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in their being able to ſtand, though they have ſinned, but in their ſins being pardoned; hence ye will find them ſadly exerciſed in wreſtling under the burden of guilt, upon their groſs out-breakings, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. ye have them praying for the pardon of great iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>For thy Names ſake pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</hi> Ye have them pleading for mercy upon the account of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable evils compaſſing them, and their iniquities take hold of them, and being more than the hairs of their head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.11, 12. And when they are delivered from groſs out-breakings, ye have them with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. groaning under a body of ſin and death, till they attain to a ſong of thanksgiving thorow Jeſus; ſo that not only doth the Text hold out the infallible verity of this truth, but the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal verity of it, that if God mark iniquity, none can ſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47356:44"/>The 5th thing I gather from the Text is, that the infallible and univerſal verity of this aſſertion, that if God mark iniquity none can ſtand, might be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cloſed with, if men were eying God much; this I gather from the Text, where the Pſalmiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats the Name of God twice, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity:</hi> And then again, <hi>O Lord, who,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore is this twice repeated in this aſſertion? Certainly not by way of idle repetition, condemned <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. in <hi>many</hi> that <hi>ſay Lord, Lord;</hi> nor meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Pſalmiſt is affected with that which he is ſpeaking of, for ſo the expreſſion of affections, or mens being affected with a thing, is expreſſed by a doubled Exclamation, which may come in in the own place, when I ſpeak of the pardon of ſin; but here, it is to make this truth out, that ſerious and frequent repeated thoughts of God, is a mean to give folk a right ſenſe of the deſert of ſin: And to make out this, conſider, partly that when we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think of God, we know that he is Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to find out that which is hid from the world; Omniſcient, to find them guilty that are innocent to others; Omniſcient, to know more of us, than we know of our ſelves; A conſideration that <hi>John</hi> would have us marking, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things.</hi> If we know ſo much naughtineſs of our ſelves, by our ſelves, what muſt God know, who knoweth all things? And <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of this conſideration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> (to wit in the adminiſtration of his Office) <hi>yet I am not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47356:45"/>
is the Lord.</hi> Partly, if we will conſider what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the Names of God, here made uſe of by the Pſalmiſt. We will find it further clear; the firſt Name <hi>JAH,</hi> is a diminutive from <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> that imports a Supream Independent Beeing. The ſecond name <hi>ADONAI,</hi> ſignifies his <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Lordſhip:</hi> Ponder theſe well, and what a dreadful ſight will it afford of the unſpeakable deſert of ſin? A ſinner in ſinning rebels againſt a Supream Beeing, from whom he hath his beeing. This is made a great aggravation of ſin, to <hi>Belteſhazzar</hi> the greateſt Monarch on earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Thou haſt lifted up thy ſelf againſt the Lord of heaven, the God in whoſe hands thy breath is;</hi> thou haſt renounced thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on him, from whom thou haſt thy beeing. Sin is alſo the caſting off of the Yoke of his Dominion and Lordſhip, it ſays upon the matter, that which ye have aſſerted of wicked men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. <hi>They ſay, with our tongues we will prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> That's the Language of every ſinner in ſinning, and not only doth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by ſinning caſt off the yoke of God's Dominion, but he denys his Power and Juſtice, to exerciſe that Dominion to do him skaith; therefore when the Lord would move men to fear him, he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Dominion over the Creatures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth it, in his bounding of the Sea, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Fear ye not me? ſaith the Lord, will ye not tremble at my preſence, which have placed the ſand for the bound of the ſea, by a perpetual decree, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs it,</hi> &amp;c. A conſideration that a ſinner in ſinning, minds not, or he does defy it. Thus it is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47356:45"/>
not unfitly determined that though ſin be not infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill in its kind, for then no diſtinction ſhould be among ſins, nor an infinite ill in its beeing, for then all ſins ſhould be one, or equal, and a finite Creature cannot act that which is infinite, yet ſafely it may be ſaid, that in reſpect of the perſon againſt whom it is committed, it hath an infinite ill in it objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as being againſt an infinite Majeſty, in Beeing and Dignity, and conſequently there is no ſtanding if he mark it.</p>
            <p>But 6ly, for further proof of this aſſertion, and for proof that the Saints do ſo ſee God, as to give them a right ſenſe and ſight of the deſert of ſin, I ſhall add this in the Text, that when the Saints are in a right frame, they are great Students of the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfulneſs and hainouſneſs of their ſin; therefore a Saint ſees that none can ſtand before God, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity, becauſe when a Saint ſees God to be his Party, and is in a right frame, he paſſes no ſin, as inſignificant or little, but he is an aggravater of his ſin; and this I gather from the name that the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt gives ſin in the Text, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniquities,</hi> he calls them not only many iniquities in the Plural Number, (of which I ſhall not now ſpeak) but iniquities groſs in their nature, and <hi>if thou, Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhould mark ſins,</hi> as ſuch, <hi>who could ſtand?</hi> If I thought that I would not be cut ſhort by the time, I would here obſerve, that the name of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Tranſgreſſion, is frequently given to ſins of a groſſer nature, not ordinary, that are contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed to the ordinary infirmities of the Saints. To theſe ſins <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. of which it may be ſaid, <hi>They
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47356:46"/>
are not the ſpots of his children;</hi> To theſe ſins, of which <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21, 23. <hi>I have not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly departed from my God, and I have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity:</hi> And of theſe ſins which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> (9.5) confeſſeth, <hi>We have ſinned, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted iniquity, and done wickedly, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, even by departing from thy precepts, and from thy judgments.</hi> But yet I find the Saints, even in ſpeaking of their ordinary infirmities, not ſparing to give them the name of Iniquities and Tranſgreſſions, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me, O Lord, as for our tranſgreſſions thou wilt purge them away:</hi> where ſins get the name of iniquities, and iniquities prevailing againſt Saints, and the name of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>The ſins that were innumerable, and moe than the hairs of</hi> David's <hi>head,</hi> were his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary failings, yet they are ſaid to <hi>compaſs him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi> and are called iniquities that had taken hold of him, ſo that he was not able to look up. And if it be enquired upon what account the Saints do look on all their ſins as iniquities, and tranſgreſſions? I might obſerve from that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> That every ſin, as well as groſs ſins, hath an iniquity, a perverſneſs in it, that muſt be pardoned; but ye ſhall particularly take notice of theſe three; 1. That the tender and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible frame of Saints, leads them not to extenuat, but to aggravat their ſin, they dare not minch their ſin; their tender frame leads them to lay it out in all the aggravating circumſtances thereof; and it's a fruit of their tenderneſs ſo to do. And 2ly, A fight
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47356:46"/>
of God, (which is here ſupponed in the Pſalmiſt) is a magnifying Glaſs, wherein a Saint will be made to ſee and look upon ſin, even the leaſt ſin, as moſt hainous. It made <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. <hi>to abhor himſelf;</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.5. to cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips.</hi> A ſight of God will repreſent a very ordinary infirmity, as very hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to him that ſees God. But 3ly, and laſtly, Every ſin, even the meaneſt infirmity in a man, it proves an iniquity, if he think lightly of it, or thinks he may paſs it lightly, without running to the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of pardoning mercy; the leaſt ſin he is guilty of, will on that account be an iniquity.</p>
            <p>Now having taken ſome time to lay open this weighty Point, anent the deſert of ſin, before you, That which I have ſaid in Explication of it to you, might eaſily be made Practical by you, if ye were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, and applying it to your ſelves; yet for your help herein, I ſhall add ſomewhat for Uſe.</p>
            <p>The general Uſe is, to intreat you, as ye love the eternal happineſs of your ſouls, to learn to ſay over this Text ſenſibly, with Application to your ſelves. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity, O Lord, I cannot ſtand.</hi> It were a bleſſed part of a very lawful Liturgy, for a man once a day, to ſay this over, <hi>Lord, if thou mark iniquity, I cannot ſtand.</hi> Let me exhort you to mind this more, to make it your daily ſtudy to be ſenſible of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and of the dreadful deſert of ſin, that ye be loſt folk in your own eyes; this is a matter that is but dallied with by the moſt part, and ſo is ſeen on it. Ye are ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Law, and <hi>Sinai,</hi> that the Goſpel and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:47356:47"/>
have but little imployment among you, it doth not reliſh with you as it ought; There are none that can ſay, <hi>But forgivenneſs is with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared;</hi> but they that can ſay, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniquity, who can ſtand?</hi> Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mercy may well get complements, it will be ſweet news to none elſe, but ſuch as have ſeen, and are ſenſible of the dreadful deſert of ſin; nay none other have right to the remedy of pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>And to help both good and bad to be more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I would offer a five-fold conſideration, to drive home the truth of this aſſertion, That if God mark iniquity, none can ſtand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Will thou take a look of God, thy Party, in ſinning; conſider him in his Supream Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, to impoſe what duty he pleaſes, and that his will is the Law of Righteouſneſs. Conſider him in his Omniſcience, to know how thou obſerves theſe duties he enjoyns, and comes up to that Law which is thy rule, thou may cheat the world and thy ſelf, but God thou cannot cheat; will thou conſider him further in his Holineſs and Purity, abhorring ſin in all, and in thee. O how loathſome and abominable is the pollution of ſin to him, a holy Lord God? Which makes him ſay, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is an abomination unto me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of aſsemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity, even the ſolemn meeting.</hi> And laſtly, conſider God in his Power and Juſtice, that if he put forth his Dominion, to call thee to account, thou being conſidered in thy ſelf, what will the iſſue be but that <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31? <hi>It is a dreadful thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47356:47"/>
the hands of the living God,</hi> where there is not a Cautioner to interpoſe betwixt Juſtice and thee; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God thus, if thou would be ſenſible of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When thou haſt taken a right look of God thy Party, in his Supream Dominion, Omniſcience, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Purity, Power and Juſtice, caſt up the Sum of thy Debt, which thou art owing to this Party, and thou wilt be like that man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.24. that was owing ten thouſand Talents. Conſider the Law in its ſpiritual ſenſe and meaning, and thou wilt find that <hi>Paul</hi> found himſelf guilty upon the account of his concupiſcence, before it came to the conſent of the will, and ſo art thou. Conſider that the Law condemns evil thoughts, unripe and indeliberat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and how many of theſe art thou guilty of? Again conſider the Goſpel, what a Maſs of Duties it commands, or recommends, upon the account of Goſpel-encouragements, and what a vaſt count or reckoning wilt thou find over thine head? Sins of commiſſion, and ſins of omiſſion; ſins in the ſeed and root, and ſins in the fruit, againſt the Law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel, in thy particular ſtation, and in thy general Calling. O! what a dreadful count will there be, if a man caſt up the rate of his duty, and in how many things he hath offended? There will be ſuch a Count, that as <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.3. <hi>That if God contend with him, he cannot anſwer one of a thouſand.</hi> There is not one of a thouſand chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, that a righteous man can put off, but he muſt ſay as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils compaſs me, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47356:48"/>
cannot look up, they are moe than the hairs of my head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 3ly, When thou haſt conſidered thy Party, and the Debt which may be charged upon thee, and the number of thy ſins, take another look of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, and their aggravations, from the times wherein thou haſt ſinned, as if they have been times of light, and it may be alſo thou haſt been ſinning with <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> when the Congregation was weeping, <hi>Num</hi> 25. When ſad affliction hath been lying upon the people of God, it may be thy ſin hath been againſt as clear light, as <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s ſin was, when <hi>he committed inceſt with his fathers concubines, upon the top of his fathers houſe.</hi> 2 Sam. 16.22. It may be when thou was under puniſhment and judgment, for former ſins, to deterr thee from future. It may be it was when thou was ſurrounded with mercies, when <hi>God was drawing thee with cords of love, with the bonds of a man, and was to thee as they that take off the yoke from thy jaws, and laid meat unto thee,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. It may be thou haſt been a perſon much obliged to God, who haſt often been refreſhed with pardoning mercy, he hath ſpoken peace to thee, upon condition thou would not return to folly, and yet thou haſt returned to it. It may be thou art one, whoſe example hath had influence to harden many others in ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot enumerat the aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin, that Profeſſors of the Goſpel have been, or are lying under, but when the Account is caſten, it will not be found an Account of Cyphers, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant petty Nothings, but an Account of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and tranſgreſſions, very hainous and dreadful, all circumſtances being conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:47356:48"/>I ſhall (in the 4th place) when you have conſidered your Party, the Sum of your Debt, the number of your ſins in their nature, and aggravating circumſtances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to ponder how juſt God is? The truth of his threatnings againſt ſin, and the curſe. Think on that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> and it were to good purpoſe, that theſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. were more frequently read and thought upon. It were to good purpoſe that we heard <hi>Moſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> thundering oftner, not to drive us from Chriſt, but to him. It's a woful trick in our hearts, that leads us to look over threatnings with a light eye. We would conſider that the threatnings will be accompliſhed, as well as the promiſes, and the leaſt farthing of the ſinners debt will be exacted off the ſinner, or off his Cautioner. Thou muſt either do, or get one to do for thee, and when thou reads the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, think on the poſture wherein thou ſtands.</p>
            <p>And 5ly, That ye may ſenſibly ſay over this aſſertion, <hi>If thou, Lord, mark iniquity, who ſhall stand?</hi> I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you to conſider the ſufferings of our bleſſed Lord. Conſider if ſuch things were done to the green tree, what will be done to the dry? And there a man that hath any ſenſe of ſin, will read the dreadful deſert of ſin, when he conſiders that wrath for ſin made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And how his Holy Nature abhorred that Cup, and put him to pray, that it might paſs from him; and how it made him in his agony ſweat drops like blood, when thou judges of the deſert of ſin by that, thou wilt ſtand then, and more ſenſibly think, that, thou wilt not be able to ſtand before God marking iniquity, for if ſuch things were done to the green tree, when his Holy Humane Nature ſuffered ſo much, being ſupported by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, what will be done to thee, who art a dry
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47356:49"/>
Tree out of him. If God would ſpeak home theſe things to your hearts, ye would Subſcribe to that Verdict <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> hath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9. that <hi>they are fools that make a mock at ſin,</hi> nay that they are diſtracted, that are lying under the guilt of ſin, and can take reſt in themſelves, till they ſee if a remedy can be had, till they come to that which follows in the Text, <hi>But there is forgivenneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> There are ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inferences that I intended to have ſpoken to from this point, but the time being paſt, I quite them. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember that which I have been upon, what hath been ſpoken to you of the dreadful deſert of ſin, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that is very neceſſary, but little laid to heart by many of you. Ye have got the Goſpel-knack among you, and have learned to talk of ſin, and of making Chriſt a refuge againſt it. But I dare not account all Gold that gliſters, nor look upon all them as real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, that can talk in a Goſpel-Dialect in <hi>Irwine.</hi> I would drive none of you from Chriſt, if any of you find your need of a Saviour, come away, he waits to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, but lay a ſolid foundation, acquaint your ſelves more with the ſinfulneſs of ſin, with the deſert of ſin, and with the impoſſibility of ſtanding before God marking ſin, in ſtrict Juſtice, that ye may cloſe with Chriſt in earneſt. God bleſs what ye have heard for Chriſt's ſake.</p>

            <p>YE have heard how the Pſalmiſt in the 1ſt and 2d Verſes, being wreſtling with plunging perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, expreſſed here under the name of <hi>deeps,</hi> gets
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47356:49"/>
guilt ſtopping his audience and ſucceſs to wreſtle with, in the 3d and 4th Verſes, wherein as ye have heard, we have 1. A ſenſible confeſſion concerning the deſert of ſin, Verſe 3. Next we have his refuge, when he is humbled with the ſenſe of that, and it is <hi>pardoning mercy, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs with God,</hi> to which he claims in the beginning of the 4th Verſe. And laſtly, ye have the end for which God lets out and beſtows pardoning mercy on ſinners, <hi>that he may be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, in the 3d Verſe, I am near a cloſe of what I purpoſe to ſay upon it, for beſide the conjunction ye have heard ought to be betwixt the ſenſe of ſin, and the ſenſe of trouble, without which the ſenſe of trouble is but bruitiſh; and beſide that ye have heard, that guilt will readily meet the people of God in ſtraits, when they are made to cry out of the deeps unto God: Beſide theſe (I ſay) I inſiſted the laſt day on that great Point, that iniquity marked by God, according to the Covenant of Works, and the Rules of ſtrict Juſtice, is that which no man is able to ſtand under; and ye may remember, how at great length, I both Explained, and continued this truth, by ſeveral Deductions from the Text, which I ſhall not now repeat. I ſhut up the Point with a general word of Exhortation, that ſinners that look for everlaſting happineſs, would learn to ſay over this Text with application to themſelves, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniquity, I cannot ſtand,</hi> and to do it ſenſibly; for the fixing of which, and bearing of it home, ye may remember, what Conſiderations were laid before you, as Conſiderations concerning God your Party, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations concerning the number of your ſins and guilt; It's called iniquities in the Plural Number, Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the nature and aggravations of your guilt, upon which account alſo, it's called Iniquities; Conſiderations alſo of the juſt threatnings of God, and of the infallible execution of them upon the ſinner, or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47356:50"/>
his Surety; Conſiderations concerning the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, a Glaſs wherein the deſert of ſin muſt be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Now before I come to the next Verſe, I ſhall mark three or four particular inferences. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ye have here a clear diſcovery, that there is no Juſtification by Works, that a man by his Works can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of ſtanding before God; Juſtification by Works, is that only, which we know by the Light of Nature, and that firſt Covenant made with mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore every man hath a natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to do his own turn that way; <hi>The Jews being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the righteouſneſs of God, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, did not ſubmit unto the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10.3. Ignorant perſons think to pleaſe God with their Repentance, and the mending of their faults, and doing better: Papiſts plead with an open mouth for Juſtification by Works; ſome Mungrel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants would mumble out ſomewhat that way; but ye are to conſider, that the Covenant requires that which is now impoſſible, even perfect holineſs, and that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being once broken, is everlaſtingly broken; and for any Evangelical Paction the Text leads us to, there is no <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt God's marking iniqiuity, and forgiving iniquity, a man muſt either ſtand to his hazard of God's ſitting down on his Tribunal, and marking his iniquities, to puniſh them; or he muſt lay aſide all thoughts of complementing with God in this matter, or of patching up a buſineſs of Grace and good Works in his Juſtification before him, they that ſtudy the firſt part of the Text well, that if God mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty none can ſtand, they will eaſily be put from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Juſtification by Works, and plead forgivenneſs.</p>
            <p>And therefore 2, I would have ſinners conſidering, that there is no ſtanding under guilt, except Chriſt be fled unto for refuge; if ye have not taken Sanctuary in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47356:50"/>
Atheiſm, that ye look upon all that is ſaid in this Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goſpel as cunningly deviſed Fables, will you but look to it, and think with your ſelves, what will you do in the day of Viſitation, and in the day of Wrath? when the juſt threatnings of God ſhall be execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and all ſinners that are out of Chriſt; when many will be ready to cry out for Hills and Mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the wrath of the Lamb. O! conſider it, if ye can be perſwaded to be in earneſt about your ſouls, what ye think to do in the day of Gods wrath for ſin. In that day wherein the ſenſleſs ſinners that made a ſport of ſin, will be made to ſing that doleful Note, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our head, wo unto us, for we have ſinned.</hi> Then ye will find it deſperate folly and madneſs that ye went on in ſin, and fled not in time from the wrath to come. Ponder that Parable <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24. (which is not to be ſtretched beyond the principal ſcope, as if there were charity for others in Hell,) and ye will find what a dreadful Bargain ſin is, when a drop of cold Water to cool the Tongue, would be an eaſe to the Drunkard in torment, and he cannot have it, when his warning of others is a witneſs againſt himſelf, that he was a deſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at man, that run ſuch a hazard, that is now paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Think I ſay, on theſe things, if ye look not on this Word as Fables.</p>
            <p>But 3. If none can ſtand before God's marking ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, then the ſenſe of guilt ſhould make us juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in all the troubles that come upon his People, when we conſider, that the Lord may for ſin, not only, as in a ſolemn day, call our terrors round about, as the word is, <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.22. But may everlaſtingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us in hell; how dare a ſinner murmur under leſſer calamities or troubles? The language of a man ſenſible of the deſert of ſin, is, that which ye have, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9, 13. [Thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſs than
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47356:51"/>
our iniquities deſerve;] and that, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. [It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.] A man that is ſenſible of ſin and of the deſert of it, ye will not find him a murmurer againſt any croſs inflicted, but a wonderer at the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhines in the ſharpeſt tryals. Therefore, (as I ſaid upon the firſt head) the ſenſe of trouble, without the ſenſe of ſin, is ill company, and will breed many diſtempers, which the ſenſe of ſin, joyned with the ſenſe of trouble, will bear down and prevent.</p>
            <p>And, 4. If even the moſt godly man, be thus lyable to puniſhment, (for who can ſtand, if God mark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity,) and even for his ordinary failings, conſider, what is the godly mans caſe, when he falleth in groſſer out-breakings. If when thou looks upon thy dayly eſcapes through ignorance, raſhneſs, precipitancy, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in duty, thou art made to lament, and ſay, (Lord, I cannot ſtand before thee, <hi>if thou, Lord, mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>) how may the lamentation be hightned, when thou falls in groſſe ſins and ſpots, and by them cauſes the enemy to blaſphem; and the truth is, were folk more frequent in laying to heart their ordinary eſcapes and infirmities, it would be a mean to caution them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt out-breakings in groſſer debordings, but when theſe are not laid to heart, and mourned for, it provokes God to write it with ſome vile blemiſh; and I ſhal add, if the Lord mark iniquity, and a godly man cannot ſtand, what ſhall become of a wicked man, who hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt? if a <hi>David</hi> (ſuppoſe he hath been the penman of this <hi>Pſalm</hi>) be trembling and ſinking under the Burden of iniquities, what a poſture ſhould mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for prophanity, who declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom</hi> be in? <hi>I</hi> confeſs they are not troubled with ſin, becauſe they forget that they have immortal Souls, but their trouble is coming. They ſee godly men plunged and perplexed, under apprehenſions of wrath, when they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47356:51"/>
are free of groſſe out-breakings; and they are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with all their impieties, but O! what a witnes is that againſt them, who walk as monſters among men, and are never troubled? ponder that word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.18. [The time is come, that judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God; and if it begin at us, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them, that obey not the Goſpel of God? and if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ſinner and ungodly appear?] If godly men dare not think of ſtanding before God, marking iniquity, how can theſe monſters for prophanity, and ungodlineſs, think to look God in the face, marking their iniquities?</p>
            <p>But now, I proceed to the ſecond General in the Text, and that is the refuge to which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he is thus humbled, and abaſed under the ſenſe of the dreadful deſerts of ſin, [But there is forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with thee. That is, thou haſt declared thy ſelf to be a pardoner of ſin on goſpel-terms, and this forgiven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is with thee, that is, it's thy peculiar right, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all pretenders. None have a right to pardon but thou, and it's thy right, when the Law, and our own Conſciences do condemn us, to ſtepin and forgive; and therefore though upon account of the Covenant of Works, I cannot think of ſtanding before thee. I betake my ſelf to the refuge, that <hi>forgiveneſs is with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a General Word that I might here mark, that is, That there is a remedy in God for all difficulties. under which the Saints are humbled, and abaſed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable, for when in the 3. verſe, he hath ſaid, [If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniquities, who can ſtand? There is a <hi>But,</hi> a reſerve, an exception added, <hi>Forgiven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is with thee,</hi> There is indeed a hopeleſs caſe, but here is a remedy for it in God; ſo that there is no caſe (how hopeleſs ſoever it be) that is deſperat, if folks go to God with it.</p>
            <p>But this I leave, and pitch upon the main point in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47356:52"/>
Text, That there is pardoning mercy in God for ſin, and this is the only refuge to a ſenſible ſinner op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſin and guilt. It's here the <hi>Pſalmist's</hi> only refuge and eaſe, when he cannot think of ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God marking iniquity. It's <hi>Job</hi>'s only refuge, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.20, 21. [<hi>I</hi> have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee? O thou preſerver of men! Thou may ſet me as a mark againſt thee, and make me a burden to my ſelf, but all that will not make thee reparation. Why doſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquity? and it's the happineſs of fallen Man, not that he is ſinleſs, or able to ſatisfie Juſtice for his ſin, but that he is a pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.2. &amp;c. [Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is pardoned, bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.] This we would not need to inſiſt on, to prove it, if ſouls were in the Pſalmiſts poſture here, if ſouls knew what it were to be under the burden of the debt of Sin, there would be no happineſs to that, to have ſin pardoned, God would be to them a matchleſs God upon this account, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. [Who is a God like unto thee, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage?] he would be a matchleſs God upon the account of his pardoning iniquity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other proof of Love he ſhould give, or withhold.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe this is a moſt important, and weighty Goſpel point of Truth, The pardoning of Sin, and I know not, when I may fall upon it in a Catechetical way, I purpoſe to quite my ordinary way, and to inſiſt upon this head, <hi>The pardon of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe and the like, through the determination of the Scriptures, may be of ſpecial uſe to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is it that God doth pardon? it is ſin or ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſo the former <hi>verſe,</hi> and this collated holds forth. It's the iniquities under which he is groaning in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>verſe,</hi> for which there is forgiveneſs with God in this <hi>verſe,</hi> ſo in that forcited place, Mic. 7, 18. <hi>He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons iniquity, and paſseth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage,</hi> and Pſal. 52.1, 2.

            <p>Now to proſecute this, I ſhall not fall upon many deſcriptions of ſin, and its nature, it ſhall ſuffice us to know, that ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and that of the Law of God, neither the croſſing of folks hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, will make a man a ſinner, <hi>James</hi> 4.11, 12.

                  <item>2. That ſin is a Crime, and a Debt, that needs a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a burden that a man will not willingly ly under, if he look right on it, nor be at reſt till he get it off.</item>

            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, all have ſinned, or done that which needs a pardon, I ſhal not need to repeat what <hi>I</hi> ſpoke the laſt day upon this, when <hi>I</hi> cleared the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of that aſſertion, <hi>That if God mark iniquity, none can ſtand before him</hi> v. 3. I ſhall only add two Scriptur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Confirmations this day. One is, that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. Where the Apoſtle writing to the godly, ſays, as to Original Sin, [if we ſay we have not ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us;] and another Confirmation, when as to actual ſin, he ſays, [<hi>v.</hi> 10. If we ſay, that we have not ſinned, we make God a liar, and his word is not in us. And another Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ye ſhall take from the Patern of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. Where theſe who are allowed to call God Father, even the godly are required to pray dayly, (forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; or as <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.4. hath it. [Forgive us our ſins.]</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more of this, but briefly mind you of theſe four. 1. It ſerves to refute the perfectiſts, that pretend to ſinleſneſs. It was the damnable error of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that they affirmed, that as we have no guilt by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, ſo Men might live without ſin, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſine crimine,</hi> without any groſs ſcandalous out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, (as we confeſs ſome ſins, or ſome way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſin, are not incident to the People of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.) But they aſſert, that men may live <hi>ſine pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato,</hi> without any ſin at all; And when they are urged with that Petition enjoyned in the Lords Prayer, where we are bidden pray for the daily forgivenneſs of ſin; They Anſwer. That men ſhould ſay that Petition <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> but not <hi>veraciter,</hi> humbly, but not truly, and in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47356:53"/>
ſincerity; which is both an imputation on the Majeſty of God, and a refutation of their error. An imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Majeſty of God, as if he did require, that men ſhould lye under pretence of humility, and a refutation of their own error: for if they ſhould lye and pray hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically, and not ſincerely, they prove themſelves, to be ſinners, and not perfect, as they pretend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We might here put <hi>Papiſts</hi> to mind, what they ſay, when they plead for the ſinleſneſs of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> though in this they do not agree among themſelves: The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> they aſſert, that ſhe was conceived <hi>Immaculat:</hi> others, as the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi> aſſert, that ſhe was conceived in ſin, but ſhe was immediatly cleanſed from it; but both of them agree, that ſhe lived without actual ſin. VVe are for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare her bleſſed above all VVomen, and highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, but we dare not contradict Scripture, which concludes all under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. Nor her own confeſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.47. Where ſhe owns God as her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which imports her acknowledging that ſhe was a ſinner; nor yet contradict our bleſſed Lord, his taxing of her as Culpable, <hi>John</hi> 2.4. When ſhe would enjoyn him by her Motherly Authority, to work a miracle, <hi>Woman</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what have I to do with thee?</hi> mine hour is not yet come, he owns her as a Woman, not as his Mother, in the Acts of his Mediatory Office; and reflects upon her as one culpable, that would require of him to work a miracle.</p>
            <p>But 3. I would from this recommend to all of you to grow in acquaintance with your pollutions, ſinfulneſs, infirmities, and manifold dayly failings. And for this, alas! we need not light Candles, there is not need of any ſecret ſearch, as the Word is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2, 34. The skirts of our Garments tell what we are, to us may be applyed that Word, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3.9. <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth witneſs against them, and they declare their ſin as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47356:54"/>
they hide it not, wo unto their ſouls, for they have rewarded evil unto themſelves.</hi> But were we as ſpotleſs as <hi>Paul,</hi> it is our duty to be exerciſed with the root of ſin, with the Body of Sin and Death, with that Law which is in our Members, rebelling againſt the Law of the mind, with that will that is preſent with us, when we delight to do good, after the Inner-man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Ye would drive this trade, and mourn for your ſecret ſins, leſt God be provoked to give you up to ſcandalous out-breakings, which the world will read, when ye are not exerciſed with ſecret ſins, ye provoked God to give you other work a do, litle to your advantage. Learn to be at that work, which the people are at, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59.12. <hi>Our tranſgreſſions</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are multiplyed before thee, and our ſins teſtifie againſt us, for our tranſgreſſions are with us, and as for our iniquities we know them;</hi> And at that trade, <hi>David</hi> was at, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. While he ſaith, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable evils have compaſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up, They are mo than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> Eſtrangement from our ſinfulneſs is an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our humility, all the croſſes in the world will not humble, or bring a man ſo low, as acquaintance with his own pollutions, and ſinfulneſs of his nature; Eſtrangement from ſinfulneſs, is a great obſtruction to repentance, he cannot be a penitent, that is not a dayly ſtudent of his own failings, and infirmities, and eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſinfulneſs is an impediment to pardon; for ſin muſt be taken with, and confeſſed, before we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect pardon, and that cannot be while we live eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it: Thus you ſee the loſſes that follows the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of acquainting our ſelves with the ſinfulneſs of ſin, our dayly pollutions and infirmities.</p>
            <p>But the 4. and laſt Word I ſhall give you from this, (and <hi>I</hi> ſhall go no further for the time) ſhall be this, that the conſideration of the univerſal ſinfulneſs of all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47356:54"/>
mankind, ſhould excite folk much to commend God; it commends God, as upon many accounts, ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon theſe two, one is, that he ſpares the World dayly, though there be ſo much ſin both of Saints and others abounding in it, who would fit with ſo many wrongs as God gets every day, and yet he deſtroyes us not, how often might he ſay, as he ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> Exod. 32.10. <hi>Let me alone, that my wrath may wax bot againſt them, and that I may conſume them, that I may ſweep them away from off the earth;</hi> and yet he doth it not, how often might he do with us in this World, as he did with <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the old World, and yet he bears with us. How often might he make the viſible Church a terror to it ſelf, and all the World? and how often might he make the Saints a burden to themſelves, and yet great is his goodneſs, that he ſpares a ſinful VVorld, and ſinners in it. And upon another account it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends God, and that is, that he lets not the ſinfulneſs of his People make void their intereſt in him, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ſinfulneſs, allows them to call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That though they be dayly, by their repeated provocations, iniquities and tranſgreſſions, drawing Rods forth from his hand, yet that doth not make void the Covenant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32, 33. [That he will viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes, nevertheleſs his loving kindneſs will he not utterly take from them, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail.] O! but the ſtudy of our ſinfulneſs would make dayly a new wonder to us, it would not be common news, [but a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, That Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And as we grow in the ſtudy of our ſinfulneſs, the ſweeter ſhould theſe Truths that holds out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of ſin grow and continue.</p>

            <p>AFter that I had ſpoken to this godly man his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſenſe, and fight of the deſert of Sin, in the third <hi>verſe. I</hi> have begun to ſpeak to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of pardoning mercy with God, upon which he layeth hold; and I took up the words in that General Note, That there is pardoning mercy in God for Sin, and that is the only refuge for ſinners, ſenſible of the burden of ſin, and of the deſert of ſin; and told you, that I have a purpoſe, (if the Lord will) to proſecute this Point, in the reſolution of ſeveral Queſtions, which yet may be reduced to a few General Heads, Which were hinted at. That which now I am upon is, the conſideration of that that is pardoned, Sin, Iniquity, or Tranſgreſſion, where I ſpoke to one particular; that all Mankind have ſinned, and done that which will need a pardon. They have iniquities, even the moſt godly which makes them, when they are ſenſible of them, to look upon it as good news to hear of pardon, That which I further propoſed to be ſpoken to, was, 1. That, as all have ſinned, ſo ſin is a crime, a debt, a burden, that men ſtand in need to rid their hands of. 2. That ſin is a debt that man cannot ſatisfie, but muſt have it done away by Remiſſion, it muſt conſequently follow, That the unpardoned Man is in a woful plight. And 3. That if this be a Debt, that can only be done away by Pardon, then to a ſenſible man, this will be the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of good news, <hi>That there is forgivenneſs with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Firſt of theſe, and the Second in Order, propoſed to be ſpoken to on this Branch, when it is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47356:55"/>
granted, that all have ſinned, the ſtupid and carleſs will look lightly upon it, wherefore it is to be conſidered in the next place, what ſin is to the right diſcerner, it's a crime, which, ſince he cannot expiat, hath need of pardon; It's a debt, which, ſince he cannot ſatisfie, hath need of forgivenneſs. This imports, that to be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the burden of ſin, is no light matter, to a man that knows his caſe through ſin. I ſhall take notice of the Notion, under which ſin is expreſsed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.4. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. Where ſin is called our Debt, I ſhal no inſiſt here to clear, that every mans ſin is his own Debt, contracted by himſelf, in his own Perſon, or in the common Root <hi>Adam;</hi> and that he hath not others to blame for it, Though as <hi>Adam</hi> did lay over his ſin on the Woman, which God gave him, ſo is every one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do, yet when God and the Sinner reckons, he will find, that he muſt reckon for his Sin, by himſelf, or by a Surety; but waving that, that ſin is called a Debt, it is not to be underſtood, that Man is oblidged to ſin, for Obedience is that which is required, and which we are oblidged to pay to God, but what is imported in this metaphor, I ſhall lay open before you in theſe four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A man that is adebted, and not fulfilling his Bond, is lyable to the Law, ſo the Law of God is an hand-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt ſinful man, oblidging him, either to do his Duty, or to ſatisfie Juſtice for his Fault, or if he cannot do that, and there be no other remedy, to undergo ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment in hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Debt is heightned by this, that all the means offered to Man, of directions, threatnings, promiſes, opportunities, power, and abilitie, to do good in the time, and ſtation, he lives in, Gifts, and qualifications for that end, and Talents, for the not improvement of which, he becomes Debtor to God, and his ſin is hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47356:56"/>3. As ſin reſembleth a Debt, ſo it is a Debt above all other debts, a man under the debt of Sin, is in a more dreadful plight, than any under other debt; he may be able to pay it, and though he be broken, he may come up again; But a man under the debt of ſin, can never pay; again a man under debt, if he cannot pay, he can ſhift his Creditor; But for a man under the debt of ſin, there is no ſhifting of God his Creditor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he go from his ſpirit? Or whither ſhall he flee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom his preſence!</hi> Again, though a man be under debt, and not able to ſhift his Creditor, yet his Creditor is not always in a readineſs to attach him, though he be in his view, becauſe he is not in a legal capacity to reach him; But we are in God's reverence every moment. Again, other Debt reaches the Body only, this Debt of Sin rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Soul alſo. And to add no more, other Debt may reach a man with inconveniences in his Life, but when he is dead his Debt is payed. But the puniſhment of this Debt reaches a man chiefly after this Life: all theſe clear, that Sin is a Debt above all other Debts.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall add 4. That Sin may well be compared to a Debt on this account, that Sinners while they fall upon a right method of ſeeking pardon, they much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble an ill Debtor; an ill debtor deſires not to hear of his accounts, far leſs to ſit down and caſt them up; ſo it is with theſe ill Debtors, they put the ill day far away. They cannot hear of a day of compt and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, nor to ſit down and examine what they are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what is it that engadges a Man, either to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to be an Athieſt, (I ſay eſſay to be one, for he will never be one in earneſt) or turn Voluptuous, and drown himſelf in ſenſual pleaſures, but to hold down the eye of his Conſcience, that would call him to compt and reckon. Again, when an ill Debtor is brought to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47356:56"/>
think upon his accounts; how aſhamed and afraid may he be, not knowing when he ſhall be ſeiſed upon, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of all he hath, and put in Priſon. And though impenitent ſinners will not let it light, that they have any fears, yet their Conſciences can bear them Witneſs to many over-caſtings of heart, upon apprehenſion of what may be the cloſe of their Courſe. Again ill Debtors are full of dilators, ſhifts, and delayes, they will promiſe fair, but will not perform; and ſo it is with ſinners, that are not thinking on Repentance, in order to Pardon. They will take fair in hand, many have that much good Nature, Civility, or Policy to take with a reproof, and ſay, they will mend, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they will caſt off the courſe they are in, and do better, but all theſe are dilators, to give the Creditor fair weather, without ſatisfaction. And further, to add no more, an ill Debitor loves not his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yea often hates him; and though impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners dare not ſay, they do not love God, yet what ſpightful and hateful thoughts do often riſe up in their hearts againſt God? Why? they cannot get this done, and that done, but they muſt be accounted ſinners, and cited to appear before the Judgment Seat of God, to undergo a ſentence of puniſhment, and is that good thus to repay him ſo, becauſe he craveth this Debt? All theſe Reſemblances, contribute to make it out, that man is a Debtor, and ſin is a debt, that he cannot ſatisfie. Are they not fools then, that make a ſport at Sin? (as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9.) <hi>Fools make a mock at ſin;</hi> but they would ſport at leaſure, if they conſidered what a debt this debt of ſin is. Men in their right wits, have ſo ſmarted under it, and the conſequences of it, that their hearts have been ſmitten, and withered as graſs, and they have forgotten to eat their bread. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.4. <hi>They have had no ſoundneſs in their fleſh, becauſe of Gods anger, nor reſt in their bones, becauſe of their ſins.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47356:57"/>
Their iniquities have been a burden too heavy for them, their wounds have stinked, and been corrupt becauſe of their fooliſhneſs. Pſal.</hi> 38.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And where art thou that art lying under that Debt, and never thinks of putting it off? Certainly thou muſt be under a diſtraction.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the third Thing in Order, that I propoſed to be ſpoken to, that is, That ſin being a great Debt, and a debt we cannot ſatisfie, a man lying under it, if he be ſenſible of it, will look upon it, as the ſadeſt poſture and plight he can be in. Sin will be a moſt heavy burden to a ſenſible man; and I ſhall in ſhort make it out, in a five-fold reſpect, what a woful plight an un-pardoned criminal and debtor is in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An un-pardoned Man is a dead Man, a gone man, as the Lord tells <hi>Abimilech,</hi> Gen. 20.3. <hi>Behold, thou art but a deadman, for the woman which thou haſt taken, for ſhe is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans wife.</hi> Every unpardoned man is a dead man, he is like a condemned Malefactor, the ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him, the day of his death is appointed, though he eat, and drink, and ſleep, he is reckoned a dead man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An unpardoned man is capable of no good thing, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59, 1.2. <hi>Behold, the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave, neither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have ſeparated betwixt you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Your iniquities have turned away theſe things, and your ſins have withholden good things from you.</hi> They have turned away the good things ye had, and have withholden other good things from coming to you; ſo that the unpardoned man is capable of no good, and all the good that he gets, is but a ſnare to him. The good things he hath, are feeding, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An unpardoned man is in a woful plight, becauſe, all that he doth, till his perſon be reconciled, and taken
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47356:57"/>
into favour with God, how good ſoever it be in it ſelf, is ſin, and an abomination to God; He may do many good turns, that are good upon the matter, but would ye have the Scriptures verdict of them, as they come from him: read <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. and 28.9. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, the plow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng of the wicked is ſin; He that turns away his ear from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, even his prayer ſhall be abomination;</hi> Whence it is clear, all the good that an unpardoned man does is ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An unpardoned man is in a pitiful plight, becauſe to him there is no comfortable bearing of trouble, but where the pardon of ſin is, it ſuſtains a man under trouble, and makes him bear it cheerfully; Men that never trouble themſelves to repent, and ſeek pardon, they had need of much fair weather, for unpardoned guilt will have a dreadful Eccho in a ſtorm to them. Of the pardoned man it's ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.34. <hi>The inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, for the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquities.</hi> A man's being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given his iniquity, will make him forget that he is ſick, and will make him bear trouble comfortably, which an unpardoned man cannot get done.</p>
            <p>And 5 an unpardoned man is in a woful plight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe death will have a terrible aſpect upon him; To the pardoned man, death is a friend, a Meſſenger ſent to call him home, a Chariot ſent to carry him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but to the unpardoned man, death is the King of Terrors, the wages and curſed fruit of ſin; O! the ſweet ſight of Chriſt, and of pardon, that meets the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man at Death, and Judgment, ſomewhat whereof is hinted in theſe Words, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19.26. <hi>Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Jeſus Christ, who before was preached unto you.</hi> But O! what a dreadful lying down,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47356:58"/>
and riſing out of the Grave, will the unpardoned man have; So ye have heard, that as all have ſinned, ſo ſin is a Debt, that hath need of pardon, the non-forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof, puts, and keeps a man in a moſt wofull condition, and being ſo,</p>
            <p>I proceed to the 4th, and laſt thing, I propoſed to be ſpoken to here, that is, that ſin being a debt, and ſuch a debt, as can only be taken away by pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenneſs, then it might be good news, the chiefeſt of good news to the man ſenſible of ſin, that iniquity will be forgiven; That <hi>there is forgivenneſs with God,</hi> and this is it in the Text, for <hi>verſe</hi> 3. he ſayeth, <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldeſt mark iniquity, Who can ſtand.</hi> But <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>Forgiven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is with thee.</hi> That is it ye have, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Son be of good chear, thy ſins be forgiven thee.</hi> Now for this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the nature of it, and the terms upon which it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it will come in, in the own proper place to be ſpoken to. Here, I am upon conſideration of the thing remitted, and that that I ſhall pitch upon is, That there is a remiſſion of ſin attainable by ſinners in the due order. It's a bleſſed Article of our Creed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins. When I ſpoke of the remiſſion of ſin, I ſpoke of the remiſſion of all ſins, great and ſmall, in their nature and number. <hi>There is forgivenneſs with God, for iniquities.</hi> I confeſs there is an exception made, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.31, 32. <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy, shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, shall not be forgiven,</hi> Heb. 10.26. <hi>They that ſin afer they have received the knowledge ef the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> And 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.1. <hi>There is a ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death;</hi> But the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, needs not trouble the ſenſible ſinner, that would fain have pardon. It is true, it ſhould warn all to beware of malicious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt light, and having ſinned, to beware of running away from God, but the ſenſible ſinner, that is ſeeking peace, and pardon, needs not to be afraid of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47356:58"/>
it. That ſin is therefore irremiſſible, becauſe the ſinner comes not to ſeek pardon, but if thou haſt the ſenſe of ſin, and if it be thy deſire, and endeavour to repent, and to have pardon, it is an evidence, that thy ſin is not that unpardonable ſin.</p>
            <p>But that I may make ſomething of this, <hi>I</hi> ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in two or three Branches. The firſt whereof ſhal be,
<list>
                  <item>1. That ſmall ſins need Pardon.</item>
                  <item>2. That groſs ſins are Pardonable.</item>
                  <item>3. A word to the conſideration of the perſons whoſe ſins are pardonable.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſmalleſt of ſins needs a pardon, we are not (as <hi>Papiſts</hi> would charge us) Stoicks, who affect a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and equality of all ſins; we grant there are different degrees of ſins, and different degrees of puniſhment, <hi>A beating with many stripes, and a beating with few ſtripes, Luke.</hi> 12.47, 48. But yet when we aſſert this difference, we dare not with them aſſert venial ſins, that deſerves not everlaſting Wrath without repentance, and fleeing to Chriſt for refuge, ſure the Apoſtle tells us. <hi>Rom,</hi> 6.23, <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> What death? look to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and it will clear it, <hi>but the gift of God is eternal life;</hi> if the Gift of God be eternal life, the wages of ſin muſt be eternal death, &amp; that he ſayes it of ſin inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly, it's equivalent to an univerſal, the wages of ſin is death, ſo that they muſt take away the nature of ſin, from theſe ſins they call Venial, or grant the wages thereof is death, and likewiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. Chriſt tells, that <hi>Every idle word that men ſpeak, they shall give account thereof in the day of Judgment;</hi> And an idle word might ſeem a ſmall ſin; well then, if the ſmalleſt ſin needs a pardon, look that we do not practically make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of mortal and venial ſins, even groſs men, if they fall into groſs out-breakings, it will affect them ſomewhat, when they do not heed their ordinary eſcapes. Godly perſons alſo are culpable here, a ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47356:59"/>
ſin will affect them, and ſo it ſhould, but how little are they affected with wanderings of mind in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, idle words and thoughts, habitual diſtance from God, and is not that a practical diſtinguiſhing of ſin: It is true, none can, in repentance, diſtinctly overtake all their failings, for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> Yet we ought to do what we can, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, and if we cannot overtake them, be at Gods Foot-ſtool with them, mourning over them in the bulk.</p>
            <p>But 2. as the ſmalleſt of ſins needs a pardon, ſo the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>roſſeſt of ſins are pardonable in the due order, <hi>There is forgivenneſs with him for iniquities,</hi> as in the Text, and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will aboundantly pardon.</hi> He will pardon greateſt ſins in their nature and kind, and hence <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</hi> And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.18. The Lord ſayes, <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together, though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they shall be white as ſnow, though they be red as crimſon, they shall be as wool.</hi> And theſe great ſins are pardonable in the due order, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be done in ignorance, as <hi>Paul's</hi> perſecution was, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I was a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and injurious, but I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.</hi> Or whether they be committed through the power of temptation, even againſt light, as <hi>Peter's</hi> three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold denyal of his Maſter was, yet not being malicious it's pardoned. Again as great ſins for nature and kind, are pardonable, ſo great ſins for the multitude and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, when they are like a cloud, and a thick cloud, he will blot them out. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.22. <hi>I have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out as a thick cloud thy tranſgreſſions and ſins.</hi> And that word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>He will aboundantly pardon,</hi> In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal it is, he <hi>will multiply to pardon one and moe, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.11, 12. <hi>David</hi> pleads <hi>for mercy
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47356:59"/>
for innumerable evils; for iniquities that are moe than the hairs of his head.</hi> And as God pardons great ſins for kind, and many for number, ſo frequent relapſing in theſe ſins, (which I may ſpeak to afterward) <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>She that hath played the harlot with many lovers, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to return.</hi> And he that bade <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 18.22. <hi>Forgive his brother, not only ſeven, but ſeventy times,</hi> will much more do ſo, to his penitent People, renewing their repentance: But when I ſay he will pardon great ſins, I would have it well applyed. It is not to embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en any body to ſin, thou that ſo improves this Doctrine, does turn the grace of God into wantonneſs; and thou that ventures on ſin, becauſe God is merciful, to pardon great, and many ſins, and thinks thou may take a whelps fill of ſin, and then go and repent, and get mercy, (the woful ſhift that many follow) O! remember that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not in thine own hand; nay, I will ſay more, thou bears a ſad evidence of one that will never get the grace to Repent; but that abuſe of this doctrine being laid aſide, ye ſhall (while I am upon the explication of this great Article of Faith,) take a word or two of Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the by. And 1. It may be great encouragement to ſenſible ſinners, thou who art ſenſible of thy ſins, thy Dyvour-bill of great and many ſins, if thou come in the right order, needs not keep thee back, thy deſire to come and repent, and ſeek pardon, tells that thou art not guilty of that unpardonable ſin, and therefore ſtand not a back for ſcarlet and crimſon coloured ſins, nor for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing in theſe ſins, <hi>There is forgivenneſs with God for thoſe iniquities;</hi> and that ye may grip the better to this when it is intimate, that God is ſuch a pardoner of ſin, ye would look to the infinit price of the Son of God, whereby he purchaſed pardon, and upon which pardon of ſin is founded, and ye would look to that infinite and ſuperabounding grace in God, inclining him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and when theſe two are laid together, &amp; well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47356:60"/>
all thy doubts about pardon, will amount to this, whether thy iniquities, or Chriſt's death, thy abounding ſin, or Gods ſuperabounding Grace, will carry it? And reaſon will determine it in favours of Chriſts purchaſe, and the ſuper-aboundant Grace of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me leave this as a Witneſs againſt ſlighters of this offer of pardon, I believe there are many engadged as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. Who ſaid, <hi>There is no hope, no, for we have loved ſtrangers, and after them we will go;</hi> The matter is paſt redding. There is little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that ever we will do well, and therefore we mind not to do well. But here is a Witneſs laid at thy door, whatever thy condition be, God and thou art yet in tryſting terms, and thou haſt the offer of Pardon upon Repentance, and turning to him, art thou as mad, as the man that had the legion of Devils, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.9. will thou employ Chriſt, he can cure thee; Though thou were like <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom Chriſt caſt ſeven devils, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.2. <hi>He</hi> can caſt them out, and ſet thee down a worſhipper of him at his feet. Thy ſcarlet and crimſon coloured ſins, he can make white as the ſnow or wool. Thy ſcattered affections, as the wind, he can fix upon the nail faſtened upon the ſure place, if thou wilt come and reaſon with him, thou ſhalt find him as good as his Word, and ſhall not this be a Witneſs againſt ſlighters of pardoning Grace, that ſuch profligat wretches, runnaways, and backſliders; are within the reach of pardoning mercy, and there is a Royal Proclamation made of it, wherein it is offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet they ſlighted it. All the wrath of <hi>Sinai</hi> ſhall not be ſo terrible to ſuch, as this will be one day, that in the Name of Chriſt, we proclaimed pardon to you, providing ye ſeek it in the right order, and look how ye will anſwer the Lamb ſitting down on his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47356:60"/>I thought to have ſpoken to the perſons, who they are that are pardoned, and that they may call God Father, who ſeek pardon, and how that it ſecluds not the vileſt of ſinners upon repentance, and how it makes againſt the <hi>Novatian</hi> error, that thruſts repentance out of the Church; And to that caſe of godly men their relapſing in ſins, they have repented of, and whether ſuch be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, but the time having cut me ſhort, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to break in upon theſe for the time.

            <p>I Have now broken in a litle upon this great Article of of our Creed, the remiſſion of ſins, The great Goſpel-news, the glad tidings of the Goſpel of peace to them that are in the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> poſture, in the third <hi>verſe,</hi> that there is no ſtanding before God, marking iniquity in ſtrict juſtice, according to the Covenant of Works. I am as yet detained on the firſt head, that I propoſed to be ſpoken to on this Subject, that is, the conſideration of that which is pardoned, it is iniquity, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>verſe,</hi> ſin or tranſgreſſion, let it be called by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever name it will, and as to this, I ſpake to theſe things. 1. That all have ſin. 2. That ſin is a Debt and Burden, which they who take a right look of, will ſee great cauſe, will deſire to be rid of it. That ſin being ſuch a debt or burden, the unpardoned man, if he get a right look of his own condition, he will find himſelf in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plight, and 4. That ſin being ſuch a debt, as can only be done a way by pardon, and ſuch a burden as puts the unpardoned man in a woful plight? It follows, that it is good news, the beſt of all news, to a ſenſible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47356:61"/>
That there is pardon for iniquity in God, When a man hath ſaid. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who can ſtand,</hi> that he may add. <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>But there is forgivenneſs with thee:</hi> And here ye may remember, that it was cleared, how the leaſt ſins needed a pardon; As alſo how the greateſt ſins for nature, number, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances, are pardonable &amp; that ſenſible ſinners needed not be troubled with that ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſeing their very flying to the remedy of ſin in Chriſt, is a ſufficient evidence, that it was not in them. I was the laſt day cutſhort by time, from ſpeaking a word to theſe perſons, whoſe ſins are pardonable. And this I wold now ſpeak to, before I go to the other Heads, <hi>I</hi> propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſpoken to; And the ground of that which I would ſay of them, whoſe ſins are pardonable, I ſhall take it from that pattern of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.—12, <hi>Father, forgive us our debts.</hi> They are Children who may come to God for pardon of ſin; and to open this a litle, I ſhal ſpeak to theſe three from it. 1. It would be remembred, that theſe who are not Children, muſt come and become children in the due order, that they may attain to the priviledge of pardon; when Children only are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to beg pardon of ſin, it ſecludes none who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, from coming to God, through the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be put among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Adoption, for, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto Lord, and he will have mercy vpon him, and to our God, for he will aboundantly pardon, or multiply to pardon;</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.15.16. <hi>When the wicked man reſtores the pledge, gives again that which he had robbed, doth walk in the statutes of life, without committing ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die, none of the ſins he hath committed, ſhall be mentioned unto him;</hi> There ſhal be no more word of them; which (as I ſaid the laſt day, when I ſpake from theſe words) leaves a ſad
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47356:61"/>
check and ground of dittay, at the doors of Rebels, to whom the Fountain for Sin and Uncleanneſs is keeped open, and they have pardon in their offer, but will not follow the right method of obtaining mercy and pardon. They will not come and be children, but continue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſtill; And it leaves alſo a caution and a check to many, who, if any thing be hinted at of their faults, will claim to pardon, and yet they will not give up themſelves to be Children, they would live Rebels, and yet be pardoned. But ye would come to be made Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who in Faith would pray, <hi>Forgive us our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A 2d. Word which I would ſay from this, is, That as Children are dayly falling in ſin, ſo their dayly ſins are pardonable; There were many dangerous and damnable errors in the ancient Church, concerning the ſins of Church-members, that come here to be reproved. Some who looked upon the ſins of Church-members, as the old <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the Progenitors of the <hi>Libertines</hi> did, they held that ſins in godly perſons conſiſted only in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that regenerat men do what they would, if they ſhould commit the moſt vile and abominable Acts, they were not ſins in them. This is nothing but corrupt principled monſtruous prophani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, or monſtruous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity rooted in a corrupt principle; and thoſe that would hold themſelves out of that fearful gulf, they would beware of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> principles, as that God ſees no ſin in Believers, that his Law is not to be the Rule of their walk, that they need not repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſme</hi> is but a new Edition of <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> in <hi>Folio.</hi> Others again acknowledged ſin to be in the godly, but they ſlighted repentance, and therefore, when ſcandals fell out in the church, they did not require any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their Offence, who had fallen in theſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, but while they were reiking in theſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they entertained Church-communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them. This was a turning of the Grace of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47356:62"/>
God into laſciviouſneſs, and it is the reſult in part of that <hi>Antinomian</hi> principle of the remiſſion of ſins, from all Eternity; ſo that according to their opinion, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was not required inorder to pardon of ſin, but for intimation of pardon. And there were a 3d. ſort, ſuch as the <hi>Novatians,</hi> who looked ſo on groſs ſins after Baptiſm, as though they would ſeclude them from pardon on repentance, nor would they ſeclude ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from making profeſſion of their Repentance, yet they would not abſolve them, nor admit them to Church Communion, and fellowſhip, particularly in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, but left them to God, to make of them what he pleaſed. Now in oppoſition to all theſe, is the truth I am upon, we confeſs ſins after the receipt of Great mercies, are very hainous, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.14. <hi>Should we again break thy commands, and joyn in affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the people of theſe abominations? wouldeſt thou not be angry with us, till thou hadſt conſumed us?</hi> Judges 10.13. <hi>Ye have forſaken me, and ſerved other gods, therefore I will deliver you no more.</hi> And ſin in particular after regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is ſo much the more hainous, that God hath been gracious; therefore the Apoſtle having ſpoken of the abounding grace of God, where ſin had abounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. At the cloſe, he begins the next Chapter, with theſe words, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> He abominats that after regeneration, there ſhould be a relapſing in ſin, yet the Text here intimats, <hi>thereis forgivenneſs with God,</hi> for the iniquities of Godly men; and the Pattern of Prayer <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. Tells the Children, that they may go to God, and ſeek the forgivenneſs of ſins, which ſayes, they would be dayly ſinning, and God would allow dayly pardon on them in the due order; and conſequently, it was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelty in the <hi>Novatians,</hi> to ſeclude ſuch as fall in ſins after Baptiſm, from Abſolution and Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47356:62"/>
and they would not pardon, where God did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which made <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to ſay to <hi>Acleſus</hi> their Biſhop. I ſee no other of it, but ye would make a Ladder to go to Heaven your alone, and would have one with you. I confeſs the godly are not to be hugged under their failings, but their failings are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be aggredged, yet upright Walkers, as they are moſt tender in their Converſation, ſo are they moſt charitable in paſſing Judgment upon others, though they have their failings.</p>
            <p>But there is a 3d. word <hi>I</hi> would ſay from this, and that is to clear, whether all ſorts of ſins in the godly, are pardonable? This is a caſe that hath troubled the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and may trouble tender Conſciences, whether, when a man hath repented a ſin, and found the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and hath found God's favour and pardon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat upon his repentance, he may again fall into that ſin, and get it pardoned over again. A caſe, I ſay, that ſome who are tender, may be troubled with, when they have fallen in ſin, and thereafter have found it bitter, and have been at God, confeſſed it, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon, and yet they have been over-hailed in the ſame ſin over again. This I confeſs, before I ſay any thing to it, is a ſad caſe, it's ſad to ſee folks, after rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and taſting of the Grace of God, falling in the ſame Sins again; and it's yet ſadder to ſee a perſon, after he hath been ſmarting for it, running back to that very folly; particularly if it be an out-breaking Sin, and the Learned could hardly find an inſtance in Scripture of that relapſing in Sin in the Godly; it's true, <hi>Peter</hi> did thrice deny his Maſter, and <hi>Lot</hi> was twice drunken, and twice fell in Inceſt, but none of theſe were after Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and intimation of Pardon; for <hi>Peter</hi> was keeped in the hurry of the Temptation, till his Sin was thrice out with him; and ſo it was with <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> yet I ſhall give two words for clearing the caſe. 1. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47356:63"/>
makes not the Saints perfect, ſo neither do I ſee a ground, that a Saint his repenting for a particular fault ſhould keep him from a relapſing in that fault, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pardon. It is true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. God's ſpeaking of peace to his people, is with a caution, <hi>That they turn not ogaîn to folly;</hi> But to ſay, if Repentance be true, a man will not fall in that folly he hath repented, it is not Scriptural: Regeneration is our initial Repentance, and if that do not prevent falling in Sin, it is no wonder, that a particular Act of renewed Repentance do it not, all the Repentance grief or ſorrow that a perſon hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to for Sin, is but a creature, that except God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr, cannot keep him from falling in ſin; and God hath not made an abſolute promiſe, ſo to concur with a penitent, that he ſhall not again fall in the ſame Sin. How often doth a penitent, when he hath repented to day of his paſſion pride, wandering of mind in duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fall in the ſame Sins to morrow; and if he may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Repentance, fall into leſſer faults, why may he not after Repentance fall in groſſer; we find alſo godly men after their repenting for their failings, falling in groſſer out-breakings. <hi>David</hi> after he had repented his falling in trouble, and his uſing ſinful ſhifts to be out of it, fell in theſe groſs and ſcandalous ſins, of Adultery and Murther; and he that fell in theſe ſins after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for other eſcapes, why might he not after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance have fallen in theſe ſame ſins over again? if the grace of God had not prevented it; for though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for particular faults, leave behind it an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the bitterneſs of theſe ſins, and make them to be loathed, which will make it more improbable, they will be relapſed in, yet it is not impoſſible, otherwiſe true Repentance being for all ſin, it ſhould prevent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing in any Sin.</p>
            <p>A 2d. word which I ſhall ſay for clearing the caſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47356:63"/>
ſhall be this, that as true repentance is not to be meaſured, by relapſing in ſin, ſo it is contrary to Scripture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that relapſing in ſin after Repentance is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, It's not the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and therefore pardonable. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Our God will multiply to pardon;</hi> Even as often as the ſinner repents, and comes aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to him, to ſeek pardon, were it till ſeventy times ſeven times, as he bids us forgive others, when they ſin againſt us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18, 22. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to heal backſlidings. Now theſe are after Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when his people fall back in the ſame ſins, out of which they have been recovered by Repentance; and for inſtances of this, ye ſhall only ponder theſe two. One is, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 18. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> his joyning in affinity with <hi>Achab,</hi> for which he is reproved by a Prophet, <hi>Ch.</hi> 19.2. And his Repentance is apparent in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he fell about. And yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.35. He falls in the ſame Sin, in joyning with <hi>Achaziah,</hi> to make Ships to go to <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> in <hi>Eziongeber,</hi> which were broken, for which he was alſo reproved, repented, and was pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Another inſtance is that of <hi>Jonah,</hi> A man that fled from the preſence of the Lord, when ſent to <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> and is brought to Repentance for that ſin in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Fiſh. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2, Yet he falls in the ſame ſin. <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.2. Not in fleeing away from God, but in repining at his mercy, and in his opinion, declaring it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to go to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and juſtifying his former fleeing away: Theſe are two clear inſtances of relapſing in ſin after Repentance and Pardon for it. This I would not have abuſed. I may have occaſion hereafter to ſpeak to what prejudice relapſing in ſin brings with it; as that it will bring former pardon in queſtion, and under debate, and though a penitent may be pardoned, yet it's dangerous to bourd with ſin, after God hath ſpoken peace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to folly, and to proclaim, that all the bitterneſs folk
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47356:64"/>
have found in ſin is nothing; only I cannot conceal the truth of God, from any that may be under a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that having repented ſuch and ſuch ſins, they have relapſed in them, and therefore, as they queſtion their Repentance; ſo they think they are to expect no more pardon: ye have it cleared from Scripture, that theſe are but Temptations, That <hi>God would multiply to pardon upon repentance,</hi> Iſai. 55.7 And though folks have played the harlot with many lovers, and among hands have rewed their wandrings, they may return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. Now I have done with the firſt general head of this Doctrine, concerning the remiſſion of ſin, <hi>To</hi> wit, the conſideration of that which is pardoned.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the ſecond general Queſtion, and that is, anent the Author of pardon, or who it is that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons iniquity, even God, <hi>There is forgivenneſs with thee,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>That is,</hi> (as I exponed in the entry) it's thy property, in oppoſition to all pretenders, it's thy Property and Prerogative, when both the Law and the Conſcience have condemned, to pardon and forgive Sin. This is a truth that was held faſt in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, when it was moſt corrupt; Therefore <hi>Mark</hi> 2.7. When Chriſt pardoned the man ſick of the Palſie, The <hi>Scribes</hi> ſay. <hi>Why doth this man ſpeak blaſphemies? Who can forgive ſins, but God only?</hi> And it's one of God's Titles, [<hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. That he forgives iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſin:] and he taketh it to himſelf, as his Prerogative, [<hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.25. I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions;] and <hi>Matth,</hi> 9.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt, in curing the Palſie man, paralels the pardoning of his ſins with the healing of his diſeaſe, as proofs of his Deity: ſhewing, that both were alike difficult, and proved him to be God. I muſt here clear a ſeeming difficulty, that is, That pardon of ſin is attribut to others, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47356:64"/>
and private perſons; It's attribute to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as <hi>John</hi> 20.—23. <hi>As the Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you, receive ye the holy Ghoſt, whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained; and whoſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them;</hi> But certainly it's God only can looſe a man from everlaſting wrath due to him for ſin, and it's the Word of God only can declare whom God will pardon. Only (as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes well) Miniſters are Judges in the matter of pardon; but without any abſolute Authority in that matter. And for clearing of this, ye would diſtinguiſh betwixt the external Court in the Church, and the internal Court in the Conſcience. In the external Court in the Church, Miniſters have a power from Chriſt to remit ſcandals to ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon their ſerious profeſſion of Repentance, to take in a man that hath fallen in a ſcandalous ſin, upon the profeſſion of Repentance, and to remit the ſcandal. In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nternal Court of the Conſcience, Miniſters have a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial power upon ſcandalous ſinners their repentance, Miniſterially to declare, they are pardoned upon their Repentance, &amp; they walking according to their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, [Whoſe ſins they bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever they ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven,] <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. and 18.18. But Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>ex pleni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udine poteſtatis</hi> (as the <hi>Pope</hi> ſpeaks) have not an abſolute and illimited power to pardon whom, and when, and as they will. They are but Delegats, and muſt walk according to their Commiſſion, in pardoning of ſin, or rather pronouncing pardon of ſin, neither have they power of pardong ſin upon conditions of their own deviſing, ſuch as Pennances, Pilgrimages, viſiting of <hi>Rome</hi> in the year of Jubile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where (to mark it in the by) the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> method in this is prepoſterous; They firſt pardon, and then enjoyn pennance, and ſuch things as Chriſt hath not preſcribed; Neither muſt they take Money, and diſpence with Repentance, a fruit of Faith, upon which pardon is promiſed. This is but a cheat, to hold their Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

reeking. <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, when he had loſt an hundred thouſand Crowns at the Dice, he paſſed it in a ſport, ſaying, Thoſe are the ſins of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that is, they had been purchaſed for the remiſſion of their ſins. Again it is attributed to privat perſons; and for privat Perſons their pardoning of ſin, the Scriptures ſpeaks clearly to it, as in that patern of prayer, [<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. Forgive us our debts, as we alſo forgive our debtors] ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. [Forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you,] and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. (For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye. But private perſons forgiving of ſins, is the forgiving the injuries done by mens ſinning to them; rules anent which I may meet with ere I have done with this Theme. But though a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat perſon is bound to forgive injuries done againſt them; It is ſtill with a reſervation of God's intereſt, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt count to God; notwithſtanding from all which (to reſume) it's clear, whatſoever hand man hath in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſin, God is the principal Creditor, whoſe Law is violat, whoſe Majeſty is offended, whoſe Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, and therefore it's his property and prerogative to forgive ſins, and louſe from the obligation to wrath that ſin deſerves.</p>
            <p>In making uſe of this, I ſhall not digreſs to deal with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who in receiving pardons from their Prieſts, uſe not a judgment of diſcretion, whether the perſons pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, be acting according to their Inſtructions, and according to their own principles; for if they did, they might be eaſily <hi>nonpluſ'd.</hi> They put the power to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences intirely in their <hi>Pope,</hi> and aſſert that their Prieſts are Commiſſion at by him to diſpenſe them, but they can only have a humane Faith concerning that Commiſſion; For beſide that the <hi>Popes</hi> Power to do ſo, is upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts queſtionable; They ask, how we know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be the word of God? we might ask them, how
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47356:65"/>
they know the <hi>Pope</hi> (who muſt give theſe Indulgences to be the <hi>Pope?</hi>) That he is a Chriſtian, and hath gotten Baptiſm? For according to their own principles the <hi>Pope</hi> is no <hi>Pope</hi> except he be Baptized? Now they cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know their <hi>Pope</hi> is baptized, that being one of their grounds, that Baptiſm is not adminiſtred, except the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Prieſt go along. Now they cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Prieſt, who baptized the preſent <hi>Pope,</hi> hath had an intention to baptize him while he went about that Action, therefore they cannot be certain of any pardon this preſent <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall give them, nor can they have any thing but a humane Faith, as to the pardon of their ſins. But the Judgment of God is viſible upon them for not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth inlove, God hath been provocked to give them up to ſtrong deluſions to believe lies, and (ſhall I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?) It's a plague, and a ſnare to prophane men, that walk in the imagination of their own heart, adding drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs to thirſt, that they have this woful ſhift, get them a a Prieſt, and let them have an Abſolution, and then they are as ready to take in a new ſwack of ſin, as ever they were; this is the woful cheat that follows theit way, if folk walked like a principle of Conſcience, they were to be pitied, but when profligat men run that way, they drive their carnal intereſt, or have a ſleeping God to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, under all their abominations: But paſſing this, and leaving particular Inferences till the afternoon. I ſhall give you theſe three words. 1. If God be the only pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin, they make a very blind block, that pardon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for all their faults, that is, who can commit all ſorts of iniquities, and caſt them over their thumb when they have done; Thou that does ſo, ſhall know that God only is the pardoner of ſin ere long, and that thy pardon will not ſtand. 2. It leaves a ſad check on all them, that ſatisfie themſelves with the plaudites of the world, Why? they are good folk, cryed up and commended of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; if they have done wrong, they will confeſs it, make
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47356:66"/>
reparation, or reſtitution, but what is all that, if God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee not? though thou ſhould get never ſo many to hugg thee, or aſſoil thee, ſo long as God the only pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of iniquity doth not aſſoil thee. And 3. It leaves a ſad check alſo on them that care not to diſpleaſe God, to pleaſe Men; and O! what ſnares to men are theſe, that give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be pleaſures of men, with diſpleaſing of God. They make no bonds of any ſins, if they can pleaſe them they are obliged to. But thou that doſt ſo, will find thou haſt made an ill bargain, when the reckoning comes; for they cannot forgive thy ſin, when thou ſtands before God; neither will thou get men for thy Interceſſors, God only is the pardoner of iniquity, and therefore they make a very fooliſh bargain, who to pleaſe any, ſtand not to diſpleaſe God.</p>

But it will be a wonder to them, that there ſhould be a pardon for iniquity, that pardoning mercy ſhould be with him, whoſe holy juſtice is ſo great, who is of purer eyes than that he can behold iniquity, who hath no pleaſure in wickedneſs, and who hateth all the workers of iniquity, that ſuch a holy and juſt God ſhould pardon ſin, that his Holineſs and Juſtice ſhould combine ſo ſweetly with mercy to the ſinner, is a wonder of wonders; yea, further, this may heighten the wonder, that pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy gives acceſs to them who are ſecluded by the Covenant of works, that when, (as it is <hi>verſe</hi> 3.) (If he ſhould mark iniquity, none could ſtand,) yet as <hi>verſe</hi> 4. [there ſhould be forgivenneſs with him,] That as it is deduced, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. —22. [When by the deeds of the law, no fleſh can be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in his ſight, for by the law is the knowledge of ſin, now the righteouſneſs of God without the Law is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, being witneſſed by the Law, and by the Prophets, even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by the faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe] with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference. That there ſhould be a righteouſneſs by the faith of Chriſt, cloſing with him for pardon, O! what a wonder is that, and how good news ſhould that be to ſinners? how ſhould it quicken up, and revive any that are ready to ſink under the burden of the ſenſe of ſin? That when they look upon a holy and juſt God, that hates ſin with a perfect hatred, they may alſo look upon him as one who will pardon: That when they look to the Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47356:67"/>
of Works, their expectations are to be limited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe there is a Righteouſneſs without the Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to be had by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But becauſe ſenſible ſouls may readily think, how can this be? And may be afraid to lean their weight on a Pardon, they have ſo much Guilt, and the Conſcience i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> alarmed with it, and pardoning mercy is an Act of free Grace, whereupon they know not that they may venture; Therefore to enforce this, that God is a pardoner of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſhall not anticipat, what may come to be ſpoken to this afterwards, but the ſenſible Sinner would conſider, 1. That the pardon of Sin is an Act of Royal Prerogative in free Grace. It's an act of Princes Royal Prerogative to pardon Criminals in many caſes, and ſhall we deny that to God, which we give to Creatures? Seing He is above all Law, who can hinder him to have Mercy on whom he will have mercy? to do with his own what he will, and pardon whom he will, Salvation belongs to him, as his Prerogative Royal. 2. Senſible ſinners would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that ſatisfaction is payed to Juſtice, for their Sins, though he freely pardons, (which will come in afterward) only here, ſuch would remember, that thoughts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Juſtice of God needs not afright the ſenſible Sinner, why? Juſtice is fully ſatisfied. That fire that brunt continually on the Altar, and was not quenched by theſe Sacrifices under the Law, is now quenched, the burning fire of the Juſtice of God is now ſatisfied; and hence God in pardoning ſins, is not only Merciful, but Juſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. Upon Chriſt the Redeemer his being ſet forth as the propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, it follows to declare his Righteouſneſs, [that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus] with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflection upon his Juſtice, and hence the Apoſtle, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.) ſays, [If we confeſs our ſins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs] not only upon the account of his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that he will keep his promiſe, but upon the account
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47356:67"/>
of the Paction paſt betwixt him, and the Mediator, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the account of the Satisfaction, and Price payed by the Mediator, upon that account, he is faithful and juſt to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſin. And hence 3ly Things being thus, when ſenſible ſinners come to Chriſt, or to God through him for pardon, and yet are filled with doubts and fears, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there heſitation reſults not on the uncertainty of their pardon; for the holy and juſt God will not break bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with his Son, but partly it reſults on our ignorance of that Righteouſneſs, which is by the Covenant of Grace, we know no Righteouſneſs by the Covenant of Works, but that which is inherent, and the Ignorance of that Righteouſneſs, which is by the Covenant of Grace, is the gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d of our heſitation, and of many doubts and fears; partly it reſults on a proud competition, whether thy abounding ſin, or his ſuperabounding grace ſhould carry it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, [Where ſin abounded, grace did much more ſuper-abound] and therefore thou that comes to Chriſt for pardon, and yet will not ſettle upon it, thou would ſay upon the matter, that thy abounding ſin ſhould carry it, &amp; not his Super-abounding Grace. So much for the ſecond head propoſed to be ſpoken to, concerning the Author of Pardon:</p>
            <p>The 3d. Thing I propoſed to be ſpoken to, was anent the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the pardon of Sin, what this pardon of Sin Imports, or Is? And this when I have ſpoken to it at this time, will give the riſe to ſeveral other Queſtions, which will come in in their own place; and may be uſeful for you. I ſhall not detain you upon the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and importance of theſe Words and Phraſes, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes pardon in Scripture, that may come in afterward, that word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Forgive us our Debts,</hi> ſignifies the diſmiſſing of one accuſed, and a looſing of one bound for Debt, both concurr here, as ſins are a Debt, they are forgiven; and they are a Bond tying the Conſcience to anſwer at the Tribunal of God, they are remitted and looſed; and conſidering ſins, as accuſations, as they that are in a Court accuſed, a pardon remitts &amp; aſſollzies them. So the pardoned man may ſay, as <hi>Rom</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, it is God that Justifies,</hi> &amp;c. The word rendered pardon, or forgivenneſs (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Having forgiven you all treſpaſſes</hi>) hints at the freedom of the grace of God in pardoning of Sin; It's the <hi>Publicans</hi> Word. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. God
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47356:68"/>
(God be merciful to me a ſinner;) the word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal expreſſes pardon, with an eye to the propitiation; <hi>Pauls</hi> word alſo, [I obtained mercy,] (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.) which alſo is a word made uſe of in the new Teſtament, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb</hi> 8.12.) Intimats the yearning of the bowels of God, relative to the miſerable ſtate of the pardoned ſinner, expreſſed in pardoning. That word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8. [not imputing of ſin or iniquitie,] is borrowed from Merchants, that in caſting up accompts, paſs ſome Debts. And that word, [<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. Of covering ſin,] imports, that as ſin is a loathſome thing, ſo the pardoning of Sin, takes ſin out of the ſight of Gods vindictive Juſtice. Now all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions put together, might give ſome general hint, what pardon of ſin is, when God out of his free grace, out of the yearning bowels of his mercy &amp; compaſſion, accepts of the propitiation made by Jeſus Chriſt, and upon that accompt remitts the ſinners obligation to wrath, by pardoning ſin, diſmiſſes him from the accuſation laid againſt him; looſes him of his Bonds, puts his Debts out of his Books, and covereth the loathſomneſs of his Sin.</p>
            <p>But to follow out this a little more diſtinctly, what this pardon is; I ſhall take up both negatively, what it is not? and then poſitively, what it is? For an error here is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the firſt digeſtion, or concoction, that will not be gotten well helped in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, negatively, what the pardon of ſin is not, and for clearing of this, what I would ſay upon it, ye ſhall take in theſe five, 1. Pardon with God, is not to be confounded with our forgetting Sin, ſlighting of Sin, or taking a pardon of it to our ſelves, Gods pardon of Sin is one thing, and mens taking of pardon to themſelves is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; There are many folk that think God ſees no Sin in them, and why? they have no leiſure to look after ſin in themſelves, they think God hath forgotten Sin, Why? They themſelves through length of time, or other diverſions, have forgotten them. This is all that many have for that great Article of their Creed, [I believe the Remiſſion of Sins.]
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47356:68"/>
But do not cheat your ſelves, as I cleared before to you, from <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. Sin long ago commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, even upwards of twenty or two &amp; twenty years, if it be not pardoned, will be as g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>een when the Conſcience is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, as the firſt hour it was committed; Therefore look to it ye who forgive your ſins by forgetting them, and take not your forgetting of Sin, for God'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pardoning of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In taking up the nature of pardon, we muſt not look ſo lightly on Sin, as if there were no more ado, but we to Sin, and God to forgive; it's indeed pardoned, as to any ſatisfaction to Juſtice, that's exacted of thee, but Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be ſatisfied, that God might pardon freely. There is a Queſtion agitat amongſt Orthodox Divines, whether God, out of his Royal Prerogative might not pardon Sin without a ſatisfaction? a Queſtion that they determine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, either as they grapple with <hi>Arminians,</hi> who ſay, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt was only to looſe God from any Bond lying upon him, reſulting upon a neceſſity to puniſh Sin, or as they grapple with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny there was any ſatisfaction for Sin, payed by Chriſt. But were I worthy to umpire in ſuch a thing, there is ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in Debates ſtarted anent the Nature of God, when it is inquired, what he might do? and what he may not do? That I would judge it ſafer to forbear it. This is ſufficient for us, that in the caſe in hand, he hath declared what he will do, or not do, particularly that he will not pardon ſin without a Satisfaction. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. [Being juſtified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation throgh Faith in his Blood,] he would have his Righteouſneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the remiſſion of Sins; And that [as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion.] Thus the pardon of our Sin coſt Chriſt dear, and yet it runs freely to us, becauſe God freely laid the burden on Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt freely undertook it, &amp; God freely accepts of his ſatisfaction in our Name; &amp; ſo we come to be freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47356:69"/>
but remember ſin is with God no triffle, no light thing, that he would eaſily paſs, no, he would have his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſatisfied, that he might freely pardon, and the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this will not only comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd the love of God, and the love of Chriſt, in finding out ſuch a way, whereby par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don might come to ſinners, without prejudice of Juſtice. But further the freedom of pardon will not hide from the ſinner that is pardoned the odiouſneſs of ſin, but make it ſo much the more loathſome and vile, when he ſees his pardon ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood of Chriſt, and all his exinanition that went before, O! the pardoned ſinner looking to Chriſt crucified, and conſidering that he hath pierced him by his Sins, it will make him mourn moſt bitterly, as one that mourneth for his only Son, and like that of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the valley of <hi>Megiddon, Zech.</hi> 12.10.—So when thou looks upon pardoning mercy, thou takes not a right look of it, except thou look alſo on the ſatisfaction made to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by Chriſt, that a free pardon might come out to thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In taking up the nature of Pardon, beware that ye do not confound the pardon of Sin with Gods forbearing, or not inflicting puniſhment on ſinners; if ye confound theſe, ye will imbrace a ſhaddow, &amp; get a lie in your right hand in ſtead of pardon. Ye know what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. There is a riches of Gods goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering.

Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity, wherefore looks thou on them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth the man that is more righteous than he.

O! the wicked Doctrines, that wicked men build on Gods forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, One is, wrong thoughts of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. [Theſe things thou haſt done, and I kept ſilence, thou thought that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf.

Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not execute ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully ſet in them to do evil, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 24. They harden themſelves by God's forbearance. The riches of Gods goodneſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffering, ſhould lead them to repentance, but they abuſe it to produce hardneſs, and impenitent hearts, &amp; further, they bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in proſpering in wickedneſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12, 7. [Ephraim is a Canaanite, a Merchant, the ballance of deceit are in his hand, he loveth to oppreſs, and he ſaith, yet I am become rich, I have found me out ſubſtance. Let the Bible ſay of me what it will, the Sun of proſperity ſhines on my tabernacle, as well as on your tendereſt folk; I am as far from any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, as the moſt upright in their coverſation. But ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, forbearance in God is no pardon, that which is freſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not forgiven; It's no ſign of Divine approbation, when thou art forborn, and proſpers in a ſinful way; to theſe ends ye ſhall remember theſe 3.

How will ye prove that? becauſe he fears before him, but it ſhall not be vvell with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his days, which are as a ſhaddow, becauſe he feareth not before God. No approbation lyes in the boſom of forbearance. Another Scripture that gives a dreadful refutation to them that take forbearance for pardon, is that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47356:70"/>
[Theſe things thou haſt done, and I kept ſilence, thou thought that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes; Now conſider this, all ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in peices, and there be none to deliver.] There is a refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the wicked mans dreams anent God, and his forbearance. And if ye would have a third Scripture, take the forecited place, [<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. Thou deſpiſeſt the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of his goodneſs, forbearance and long ſuffering, not knowing that it leadeth thee to Repentance, but after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up to thy ſelf, wrath againſt the day of wrath: Thou may treaſure up other things as thou will for thy advantage, but thou ſhalt find, thou treaſureſt up wrath to thy ruine, thou may think, becauſe thou proſpers in Sin, God approves of thee (as the ſaying is, <hi>prosperum &amp; faelix ſcelus, virtus vocatur,</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is called a virtue, becauſe it thrives) yet remember, that forbearance is no Pardon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In taking up the nature of pardon negatively, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That God's pardoning of particular Sinners, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he reſtores them in favour, is not to be confounded with National Pardons, which God gives to Nations. This pardon is many times ſpoken of in Scripture, though by analogy, we may draw them to a particular pardon. So the ſcope of that place, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.19. — runs another way than to particular Perſons, and reſpects a National Pardon, [Pardon I beſeech thee the iniquity of this people, (ſayes <hi>Moſes</hi>) according to the greatneſs of thy mercy, as thou haſt forgiven this people from <hi>Egypt,</hi> even untill now. [I have pardoned according to thy word (ſayes the Lord) but truly, as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord.] I have pardoned, but yet I will puniſh, and vindicat mine honour. So that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38.

               </gap>o <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would root out <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that forecited place, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.12. That he would Diſ-inherit them, and make of him a greater Nation, and a Mightier than they, when he keeps them in their own Land, as he did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and does not root them out, or when he continues with them the priviledge of a Church, though he plague them, and weed out a godleſs generation from among them, as he did out of Iſrael, that in the ſpace of 38 years time, there was not a man of them left that were 20 years old and upwards, when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſave <hi>Caleh</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi> So the Lord may pardon a Nation, and yet puniſh them, he may by his Judgments weed out the generality of a Generation, and ſend them to the Pit, which may conſiſt with a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pardon, when he doth not cut off the Nation, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to enjoy the priviledges of a Church. But the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of a particular Sinner, is, when he ſits down at God's Footſtool, and Judges himſelf, and cloſes with Chriſt for righteouſneſs, and that's another thing.</p>
            <p>And 5. In taking up the nature of pardon Negatively. We muſt beware of confounding the pardon of Sin with the removal of Sin; the proſecution whereof, would lead me to ſpeak Poſitively; wherein pardon of Sin conſiſts, to the guilt and pollution of Sin, and the different acts of God about both; but becauſe that will give the riſe to other Queſtions, I ſhall remit it to another occaſion, only here ye ſhall diſtinguiſh theſe three. The filth of Sin, the power of Sin, and the guilt of Sin. The filth of Sin, is the foul ſtain that Sin leaves behind it. The guilt of Sin is the Offence done to God, and the Obligation to puniſhment, reſulting thereupon; the power of Sin, is the Tyrrany that Sin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes over the Sinner. Now when I ſay, we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the pardon of Sin, with the removal of Sin, ye would underſtand it aright, I grant that God ſtrikes at the guilt of Sin, and the power of Sin, both at once, which is this in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47356:71"/>
plain languege, that a pardoned ſin, muſt not be a reigning ſin; where the vertue of the blood is applyed for pardon, the power of the blood will alſo be applyed for the ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of ſin, and putting it from the Throne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the by, ye may take it as a noble evidence of pardon, when ſin is ſubdued, or if it be not ſubdued, yet ye are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged againſt your own ſinful diſpoſition, that it prevails not with your conſent; but for the filthineſs of ſin, though it be ſtricken at as ſoon as any of the former, Regeneration layes the Ax to the Root of that Tree, yet it remains in the Saints till death make the ſeparation. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7. Hath a Law in his members, rebelling againſt the Law in his his mind till Death, but the pardon of ſin is attainable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death, and given in Juſtification, and afterward, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the juſtified perſons Repentance, for particular faults, and therefore conſequently it is not to be confounded with the removal of ſin, ſin may be pardoned, and pardon of ſin is conſiſtent with the ſight of the filthineſs of ſin, for which the ſoul is abaſed before God dayly after Regeneration, though ſin doth not reign, and that's it wherein the pardon of ſin conſiſts, even in the taking away of the guilt of ſin, and the ſouls obligation to wrath, though the filth of ſin remain.</p>

But forgivenneſs is with thee;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47356:71"/>
In proſecution of this great truth, that there is pardoning-mercy with God, to be a relief for Self-condemned ſinners, I have ſpoken to two of the five heads that I propoſed to be ſpoken to upon it. 1. I have ſpoken to the Conſideration of that which is pardoned, that is Iniquity, Sin or Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or call it by what name ye will. 2. I have ſpoken to the Conſideration of the Author of Pardon, who it is that pardons ſin, and whatever hand Miniſters have in this, or what ever hand private perſons have in it, in remitting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to them, yet the Text determins God ſtill to be the principal Creditor; it's with thee, (ſays he) It's with thee alone that forgivenneſs is. I entered upon the 3d thing, I propoſed to be ſpoken to, which is the main thing in thing purpoſe, that is to inquire after the nature of this pardon, what this forgivenneſs of ſin, which is with God imports, and after a brief touch upon ſome paſſages of Scripture, whereby pardon of ſin is expreſſed, I proceeded negatively, to tell you what it is not, where I ſhew that pardon of ſin is not to be confounded with mens forgetting of ſin, and taking a pardon to themſelves; as alſo, that ſin is not to be lightly looked on, as a thing that God lightly paſſes by, when he pardons it, for he pardons none but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſatisfaction made to his Juſtice, by ſinners ſurety; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that pardon of ſin is not to be confounded with Gods forbearing, or not inflicting puniſhment for it for a time, for they may be long forborn, who yet may be unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whoſe forbearance is no ſign of Divine Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Further it was cleared, that the pardoning of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſinners, and their reſtoring in favour, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with a National pardon, conferred on a Nation, whom he may pardon, and yet puniſh. And laſtly, it was cautioned and cleared, that we ſhould not confound the pardon of ſin, with the removal of ſin, in the pollution of it; for though God ſtrike at the guilt and power of ſin, both together, yet whereas pardon of ſin is attained before
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47356:72"/>
Death, ſome filthineſs of Sin will remain in the pardoned Sinner, as long as he is in this life, and pardon of Sin may conſiſt with the ſight of the filthineſs of Sin, for which the Sinner is abaſed before God daily.</p>
            <p>And this leads me poſitively to point out what pardon of Sin imports: all that I ſhall ſay to it in general, before I break in to tell you more particularly what it is, ſhall be this ye ſhall diſtinguiſh in Sin theſe two. There is in Sin a blot or pollution of the Soul and a defaceing of God's Image thereby And there is in Sin a guilt, that is, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence done to God, by the violating of his Law, whereby the Sinner becomes obnoxious to the puniſhment that He hath threatned in his Law. Theſe two are clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable among men, a child running in a puddle, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> himſelf, and by ſo doing, he becomes guilty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing his Parents command, and is lyable to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or puniſhment. Now as to theſe two, the guilt and the blot of Sin, there are diverſe and diſtinct Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God converſant about them; for as the blot of Sin begins to be ſtricken at, in Regeneration, ſo that work is carried on by Piece-meal in Sanctification, till Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be perfected, and end in Glorification. Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sanctification are the Acts of God, converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Blot and Filthineſs of Sin, but pardon of Sin takes not away the beeing, nor the Filthineſs of Sin, as <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay, but it takes away the guilt of Sin, and the guilt of Sin being pardoned, the Sinner is delivered from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that his guilt deſerves, and this is alſo diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among Men; for a perſon having committed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous crime, that crime continues ſtill a filthy thing, and evidences a naughty diſpoſition, yet when that crime is pardoned, the man that committed it loſes not their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, againſt whom it was committed, and is freed from the puniſhment that it deſerves. So a Child that hath pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled himſelf in a mire, ſuppoſe the Parents forgive the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the filth that he hath got in the mire ſticks to him
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47356:72"/>
ſtill, till it be waſhed away another way. So I ſay, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin takes not away the filthineſs of ſin, but the guilt of ſin. And this I mention not meerly for ſpeculation, and information of the Judgment, but it ſays ſomething for their Advantage and Encouragement, who in the ſenſe of ſin are flying to Chriſt for pardon, that they be not ſcarred by the pollution of ſin, from relying on him, for the pardon of guilt. A tender Soul, ſo long as it finds the blot of ſin, it will readily doubt if the guilt of ſin be taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if we take up pardon Scripturally, the guilt of ſin is done away by pardon, though the blot of ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: I confeſs the blot of ſin, muſt not remain unmourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, it muſt not remain unſubdued, or without an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſubdue it, yet it may remain, when the guilt and violation of the Law of God by Sin, is pardoned, and paſt, that ſin may be near thy ſight in the blot and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which pardon hath put far off, as to the guilt of it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. [In thoſe days and in that time (ſaith the Lord) the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought, and there ſhall be none, and the ſin of Judah, and they ſhall not be found, Why? For I'le pardon them whom I reſerve,] only let me add that, that thou who grips to the pardon of guilt, when yet thou finds the blot of ſin remaining, and art mourning for it, remember that pardon muſt not be only a ſimple exemption from puniſhment, but that it is only a Reſtitution into his Favour, whom thou haſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Thy pardon muſt not be an <hi>Abſalom's</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that brought him back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he ſaw not the King's face. Thou muſt not ſatisfie thy ſelf with that, but thou muſt be accepted, and come into favour, that was <hi>David's</hi> prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. [Make me to hear joy and gladneſs, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce, and <hi>verſe</hi> 12. Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thine holy Spirit from me, reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold me by thy free Spirit.] But of this <hi>I</hi> will have occaſion to ſpeak in the progreſs, therefore I leave it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:47356:73"/>And having given you this general Notion of Pardon, <hi>I</hi> ſhall proceed to batter it out a little, for the clearing of four Queſtions 1. How the guilt of ſin can be ſeparated from the blot of ſin, and the ſinner pardoned. 2. Whether in pardon the obligation to puniſhment be ſo taken off, as the pardoned man falleth under no Chaſtiſement for ſin. 3. Whether the real paſſing of Pardon be one in the Court of Heaven, with that which is in the Court of Conſcience, or if the truth of pardon depends on the intimation of it to our hearts. 4. Whether, what the Lord pardons, He pardons Irrevocably, or whether upon the Contracting of new guilt, the former pardon be made void to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned man; Theſe four Queſtions I ſhall touch upon as briefly as I can, and ſure I am, theſe of you, whoſe plight anchor pardon of ſin is, ye will not weary to hear them ſpoken unto.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, Having ſaid, that the pardon of ſin takes away the guilt of ſin, while the blot of ſin remains; It's a Queſtion how that can be, ſeing theſe two are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, it's (as we ſay) <hi>propitum quarto modo,</hi> an eſſential property of ſin, that it draws under guilt, and makes the ſinner lyable to puniſhment, and it's as abſurd to ſay, that ſin can be without guilt, as to ſay, fire can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat, or the Sun without Light, guilt being as inſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a property of ſin, as heat is to fire, or Light to the Sun: But for Anſwer, this diſtinction will clear it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt guilt it ſelf, and the reſult of that guilt on the perſon ſinning, as alſo betwixt Gods offence, and diſpleaſure at ſin, and his offence and diſpleaſure at the ſinner; hence, if we conſider guilt in it ſelf, it is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from ſin, there is no pardon that God gives unto the ſinner, that takes away the deſert that ſin hath in it ſelf of the wrath of God. But if we conſider guilt, as it reſults upon the perſon ſinning, and brings him under the laſh of God's diſpleaſure, in that reſpect, guilt may be ſeparat from ſin. Sin cannot be ſin, if it bring no guilt with it,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47356:73"/>
yet the pardoning of ſin brings freedom from the actual obligation of the ſinner to puniſhment. Sin hath that evil with it, that it deſerves wrath, but a free pardon Suſpends that ill deſerving, that it doth not take effect againſt a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is fled to Jeſus Chriſt: I may illuſtrat it by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a maſſie Hammer that is lift up, and falls down by an Engine, and cruſhes that which is under it, and a ſtrong hand holding it up, and keeping it up, that it never falls down, it's as inſeparable from ſin, to deſerve everlaſting Wrath, as it's inſeparable from a ponderous weight falling down to cruſh that which it falls on, but pardon keeps up that weight of deſerved Wrath, that it falls not down to cruſh them that are fled to Chriſt; and this alſo ſerves not only for Information of the Judgment, but to meet with another caſe incident to the People of God, who, when they are fled to Chriſt for refuge, they not only meet with the Pollution and Blot of ſin, but with the guilt and ill-deſerving of ſin, which troubles them, who being ſenſible of Sin, and aſſaying to cloſe with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when they look to the dreadful Rod of Iron, that they know their ſins deſerve, they cannot get pardon of ſin cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. That's a ſtrong temptation to a tender walker, to ſtand a back; but in this caſe, we would diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt what we deſerve, and the execution of it, a pardoned Sinner would remember, that it commends Gods free Grace in pardoning Sin, that whatever his ill-deſerving be, he will not get that which he deſerves, God will not give him according to his deſerving. And though the Man fled to Jeſus Chriſt, may be dayly humbled with the ſight of the pollution, and deſert of ſin, yet he may be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the free Grace of God, that his ill-deſerving ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take effect to his prejudice.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe this is a great Point, and folk that are in earneſt about the pardon of ſin, when they are fled unto Chriſt for pardon, they may have many a ſad thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the pollution and deſert of Sin. The tender walker
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47356:74"/>
will, no doubt ſay, I am a vile body, I have that which deſerves everlaſting wrath, nay that, that God will purſue to root out, though he doth not look on us as an enemy: Becauſe that may be ground of many doubts about this matter, touching the pardon of ſin, I ſhall deſire you to take notice of ſome Scriptural expreſſions, that are very full and ſatisfactory for pardon, notwithſtanding of the pollution of ſin, and the deſert of ſin; and in following this, I would deſire you to take a look of theſe two, one is, how the Scripture declares, that pardoned ſin is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the Creditor (to wit God)? And another is, how it ſtands with the pardoned man?</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, whatever thou feel who art fled to Chriſt for pardon, yet O how fully and ſatisfactory doth the Scripture ſpeak to thy pardon; I dare not fall on all the Scriptural expreſſions that hold it forth, but ſhall briefly touch on ſome of them in theſe four ſteps. And 1. The Scripture tells, that pardoned ſin is a blotted out ſin, <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.9. <hi>Blot out all mine iniquities:</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins.</hi> It is an alluſion to a man that deletes or blots out of his Compt-book, that which is either payed or forgiven: and hence this phraſe tells, that pardoned ſin is a debt, that will never be craved nor called for; it is a debt, that God the principal Creditor hath given over, and will no more call for, ſeing it is blotted out. But 2. Becauſe it might be ſupponed that a debt delete in a Compt-book, may be looked on and read, though not to crave the debt, yet to waken reſentments. Therefore the Scripture goes a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther length in the pardon of ſin, and tells that pardoned ſin is not only blotted out, that it cannot be gotten read, but it is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vered and hid out of Gods ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Numb. 23.21. <hi>He hath not beheld iniquity in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, nor hath be ſeen perverſneſs in Iſrael.</hi> It is not only blotted out, but it is covered, and ſo covered, as is not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47356:74"/>
ſeen to be purſued with the puniſhment it deſerves; and here, the Scripture is very copious to expreſs how ſin is covered, as that he caſts pardoned ſins behind his back, or over his ſhoulders (to ſpeak ſo) that they ſhall be no more in his view, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Thou haſt caſt all my ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thy back,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> And becauſe a man may turn about and ſee that which is behind his back, therefore pardoned ſin is ſaid to be ſo covered, that (as it is <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19.) it is ſaid to be caſt not in the ſhallow places, <hi>but in the depths of the ſea:</hi> And ye uſe to ſay of a thing that is loſt irrecoverably, it is as tint as it were in the Sea-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. But further, becauſe though a thing be in the depth of the Sea, it may be dived after, and ſought out; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added in that fore-cited place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. <hi>The iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſin of Judah, and they ſhall not be found:</hi> So that the pardon of ſin, covers ſin, takes it out of Gods ſight, and puts it in the depths of the Sea, that though it be ſought for, it ſhall not be found. But 3ly. If there remain any doubt, how it can be, but the Omniſcient God muſt ſee ſin, and ſeeing it, muſt be angry at it; therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives a further account of the fulneſs of pardon, that it hides God's Face from it; as <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins;</hi> and it is a notable word, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. That God paſſes by, or over-pardons tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardons iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage;</hi> though he be an Omniſcient God to ſee ſin, yet when ſin is pardoned, he will, (as we uſe to ſay) ſee, and not ſee, he will ſee, and misken, as he that paſſes by that which might irritat him, he will not ſet his Face in that art; ſo deals the Lord with pardoned ſins in his people. But 4ly, Whereas ye have a curſed diſtinction of forgiving, but not forgetting of injuries, and temptations may be ready to uſe, and ſay, that though in the ſenſe that I have been ſpeaking of, pardoned ſins be blotted out, covered, put
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47356:75"/>
out of ſight, paſſed by, or over, that the Lord will not take notice of pardoned iniquities, to puniſh them; yet he may remember them by way of grudge againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned perſon, the Scripture ſecures us againſt the fear of that, and tells us, that pardoned iniquities are not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. <hi>Iſai</hi> 43.25. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e own ſake and will not remember thy ſins;</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. with the paralel place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. in the New Covenant it is ſaid, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſins no more;</hi> I will remember it judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally no more, to call them to an account for the ſin I have pardoned. So that ſins being pardoned, they ſhall be as if they had not been committed, as if they were everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly forgotten, no more to be remembred: ſo much for theſe expreſſions ſhewing how pardoned ſin is looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in reference to God, to which many mo might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and O what a full and ſatisfactory ground do they afford, that pardon of ſin is no complement, but a real ſecurity, and firm ground of confidence; when God hath ſaid all this who are they who looking on the pollution, or deſert of ſin, will take pardon of ſin for a complement, and not look on it as a ſolid ſecurity.</p>
            <p>And this will be further clear, if in the ſecond place we conſider how it ſtands with the pardoned man; for ye may ſay to me, much hath been ſaid for God, and of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his pardon, and that it is a real Security to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned man; but I find it not ſo with my caſe: Therefore I ſhall in a few words hint, how it ſtands with thee; Thou who art a pardoned ſinner may find much ſin and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of guilt at thy door, and lying near thy Conſcience, but the Scripture tells us, that it is otherways with thee than thou apprehends, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. <hi>So far as the eaſt is from the weſt, ſo far hath he removed our tranſgreſſions from us;</hi> That which thy fears and doubts apprehends lying at thy door, and to be as an heavy burden upon thy back ſinking thee, a pardon removes from thee, as far as the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47356:75"/>
Eaſt is from the Weſt, as far as one thing can be removed from another, as the proverbial Speech imports. Thou thinks thy ſelf to be in a woful and wretched condition, but the Scripture determines thee to be bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven &amp;c.</hi> Thou may be crying out, <hi>O wretched man, who ſhall deliver me!</hi> But the Scripture tells thee, thou art happy, and ought to thank God through Chriſt, <hi>Rora.</hi> 7.24, 25. Thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be drooping, notwithſtanding thou art fled unto Chriſt for pardon; but the Scripture-language of pardon is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi> The power and pollution of ſin may make thee droop, but the pardon of ſin may make thee <hi>drink and forget thy miſery, and remember thy poverty no more.</hi> Thy other ſores and difficulties may ſtick to thee and preſs thee down; but if thou read the pardon of ſin rightly, thou may ſay as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, why? the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> ſince I am pardoned, what can all me, what can dare at me, or trouble me, ſince I am forgiven of my ſin? In a word, the Scripture declares, That have what thou will, or want what thou will, though thou ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, loving kindneſſes are wanting, thou haſt not theſe proofs of love thou wont to receive, yet thou wants not an admirable proof of love that haſt pardon; hence is that Exclamation, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto, that pardoneth iniquity?</hi> Others may ſay, who is a God like thee in working wonders, when thou brought thy people out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> But as for me, I will ſay, <hi>Who is a God like thee in pardoning ſin?</hi> Thus if we take the Scripture-ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of pardon of ſin, as well in reference to the pardoned man, as in reſpect of God; we will find that pardon is a ſure foundation of confidence, and it is ſo excellent a Character, that if we could heed it, believe it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, to the quickning of us to run and ſecure pardon in the right method (whereof we may hear) we ſhould

            <p>I Am now entred upon the 3d, and great Head of this neceſſary Doctrine, to clear wherein it is <hi>That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin doth ſtand;</hi> and after a general Reſolution thereof, <hi>That the pardon of ſin takes away not the filthineſs and pollution, but the guilt of ſin:</hi> I proceed to name four Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to be cleared on this Subject; And the firſt (to which I ſpoke) was, how the guilt of ſin could be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, while the filthineſs and pollution of ſin remained, guilt being inſeparable from ſin; and the Reſolution was, that however guilt in it ſelf, or (as the Learned call it) <hi>The potential guilt,</hi> the guilt of ſin in it ſelf, be not taken away by pardon; yet guilt as it reſults on the perſon, or the actual ordination of the perſon guilty to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſuſpended everlaſtingly, and taken away; and for confirmation thereof, I led you through ſeveral Scriptures, to let you ſee what a ſure character pardon is; whether we conſider pardon as it is to be looked on in reſpect of God? or how it ſtands with the pardoned man? And now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further repetition, I ſhall go on with the reſt of the Caſes, tending to clear the nature of the remiſſion of ſin. A 2d. Queſtion in order, is, ſince pardon frees the pardoned man from obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Whether is this to be held, that no juſtified or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned perſon can fall under any puniſhment, or chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin? And here the Adverſaries of Truth, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts on the one hand, and Antinomians on the other, run on two extreames; for Papiſts ſay, That in pardon of ſin,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47356:76"/>
God remits <hi>culpam,</hi> but not <hi>paenam;</hi> That is, he remits the fault or guilt, ſo as not only he may chaſten (which we grant) but as he reſerves a puniſhment by way of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſin, to be undergone by the pardoned ſinner: They diſtinguiſh in this betwixt mortal and venial Sins; for mortal ſins, they grant that the free Grace of God turns eternal puniſhment into a temporal, which the ſinner muſt undergo; for venial ſins, which they ſay deſerves not eternal puniſhment, but temporal, all that temporal puniſhment they will have the pardoned man to ſuſtain it. Hence is their Doctrine of Pennances in this life, and of Purgatory after death; when Pennances are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone here, where they will have pardoned ſinners to make ſatisfaction of ſin; for this Doctrine, it would be but troubleſome to you to hear all that might be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, though we ſhould but touch on it, and therefore paſſing that groundleſs diſtinction of mortal and veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſins, ye ſhall notice theſe five anent that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as the bulk of Popiſh Religion is nothing but a well contrived Policy, or Intereſt of State; ſo this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pennance and Purgatory is nothing elſe but a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Device to make gain for maintaining their Kitchin, Pomp, Pride, and Luxury, which (as I told you the laſt day) <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> the Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, makes to appear, who while he had loſt 100000— at the Dice, paſt it in a ſport, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are the ſins of the Germans,</hi> meaning, that thereby they had purchaſed remiſſion of Sins; for here the policy lies. Once perſwade folk, that they muſt do Pennances to ſatisfie for ſin, or to go to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, what will they not do while they are alive, or their Friends for them when they are dead, to mitigat that ſatisfaction, that is their Market, and then pay well, and come to Heaven without either Pennance or Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſo that their Doctrine in this is a perfect cheat.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this their Doctrine they corrupt the Doctrine of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47356:77"/>
the antient Church, which was not ſo very ſound; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they have a trick of retaining antient Names of things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they bring in new Errors; ſo in this particular of Pennances and Indulgences, uſed by the antient Church, who while they were a diſtinct Society, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrict and ſevere in requiring publick Pennance and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for Scandals, ſome they held many years in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Repentance, ſome they held all their life: but afterward, when the World came in to the Church, and the Emperors imbraced Chriſtianity, and they, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Ones were too thin-skin'd, and would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Diſcipline, the Church did degenerat from their ſtrictneſs, and ſhortned their Indulgences; but the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church their Pennances were not to ſatisfie God for ſin, but the Church, they were not for privat and ſecret ſins, but for publick and ſcandalous offences. And the Church willing to gratifie great perſons, did mitigat theſe ſeverities to many. But the Papiſts retaining the Name, they will have theſe Pennances a ſatisfaction to God for ſin, and their Indulgences to aſſoil folk in the Court of Heaven.</p>
            <p>A 3d thing to be conſidered in that their Doctrine, which is very unhanſom for them to maintain, theſe Pennances which they call ſatisfaction, what are they? They are their Faſtings, their Ave <hi>Marias,</hi> and Pater-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, their Pilgrimages and Peregrinations, their Charity to the poor, or for a Religious uſe, their Self-ſcourgings and Whippings; now I enquire what are theſe? They are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanded Duties, or not, If they be not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duties, how can they be ſatisfaction for ſin? for will God be ſatisfied with that which he doth not require? <hi>Who required theſe things at your hand?</hi> If they be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duties, how can they make a puniſhment of them? that is a dreadful Soleciſm in their Religion; that Commanded Duties that ſhould be the joy and rejoicing of folks hearts, ſhould be turned to Puniſhments; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47356:77"/>
they be puniſhments they cannot be ſatisfaction, ſo that they have a bad impreſſion of theſe things, which they look upon as Duties, while they make Commanded Duties puniſhments for ſin.</p>
            <p>And a 4th Word I ſay to that their Doctrine, is this, That to admit of ſatisfaction for ſin, either as to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or eternal puniſhment for it, is a blaſphemous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on Chriſt's Satisfaction, as if any thing needed to be added to the Ocean of his Merit, who hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, both as to the Temporal and Eternal Curſe, due to his own Elect for their ſins.</p>
            <p>And a 5th I ſhall ſay to their Doctrine, is, That it is contradictory to it ſelf, for what is the guilt of ſin, (as contra-diſtinct to the ſtain of ſin) that is removed? It is not the potential guilt, the deſert of ſin, for that is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from ſin; it is only the actual ordination to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now to ſay, God remits the guilt, and retains the puniſhment of ſin, it is to ſay, that he remits and retains, that he pardons and doth not pardon, that he takes away actual ordination to puniſhment, that he craves the debt which he hath forgiven. This is ſufficient to refute the Papiſts on the one hand, in what they hold anent the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin.</p>
            <p>Upon the other hand, the Antinomians run on another extream, and ſay, that pardoned, juſtified perſons fall not ſo much as under chaſtiſement, let be a proper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin: And they will have all Afflictions that come upon the Godly, to be meer tryals of their Faith, and no more, and think that it is a legal Spirit that teacheth folk while they are under the Rod, to ſearch out ſin, and to be humbled for it; all that a man is called to do in that caſe (ſay they) is to maintain his Faith in adhering to the Love of God in Chriſt, for whatever Affliction come, it is not for ſin, and it is no wonder they maintain the Saints cannot fall under affliction for ſin, or chaſtiſement for ſin, ſeing they maintain, God ſees no ſin in them. To
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47356:78"/>
clear the mind of God in this particular. There are ſome things that muſt be granted as truths, and there are ſome other things to be cautioned againſt as error. The truths that are to be granted, may be reduced to theſe four words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That juſtified perſons never meet with condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what temporal lots ſoever they meet with, and though they be not ſecured againſt the croſs, yet they are ſecured from condemnation. 2. That a pardoned and juſtified child of God, doth never come under the wrath of God, though juſtified perſons may come under Gods Fatherly diſpleaſure, yet they are never more objects of divine wrath as others; though they may often meet with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and Divine diſpleaſure, as children, they come not under wrath, as enemies. 3. That pardoned and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſinners never fall under proper puniſhments for ſin, or afflictions to ſatisfie for their faults, though for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends they may, as to invite them to repentance, and to be humbled for their ſin, to mortifie ſin, to caution them againſt ſin for the future. 4. That many trials and afflictions come on pardoned ſinners, wherein God doth not purſue them for ſin, but is trying their faith and their graces: Such were <hi>Jobs</hi> trials, though <hi>Elihu</hi> tells him what he was, he had ſin, and his ſin deſerved all was come upon him; yet betwixt God and Satan all his trials were ſtated on this, whether he would prove a godly man, and continue ſo, notwithſtanding of them all; and ſuch were theſe trials under which the Apoſtles and other godly perſons did glory: God in theſe was not purſuing ſin, but taking ſervice and proofs of their faith, love, zeal, patience <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the croſs from them; and to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.2.3. When the Diſciples aſked him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng, <hi>Maſter, Who did ſin? This man, or his parents, that he was born blind.</hi> Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents:</hi> That is, God was not puniſhing his nor
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47356:78"/>
his parents ſin in that ſtroak of blindneſs, <hi>but that the works of God might be made manifeſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe truths being conceded, there are other ſome things to be caution'd againſt, as error, and I ſhall reduce what I would ſay for Caution, to theſe three Heads. 1. It is certain, that ſin is the in-let to all affliction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> Death, that is, all calamities, which are a begun death, and the great death, the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body. And hence what-ever may be God's deſign in any affliction he ſends on godly men, it is their wiſdom, while they are under the Croſs, to ſearch out and be ſenſible of ſin, and to be humbled for it before God, as we ſaid before, when we was on the 2, and 3. verſes, That ſenſe of trouble ſhould be attended with the ſenſe of ſin: The ſenſe of ſin is good company when ſenſe of trouble is ſharpeſt; and therefore though <hi>Job</hi> was under a cleanly tryal, yet <hi>Elihu</hi> tells him he had ſin to deſerve all that was come upon him, and if he conſidered his ſin, he would quarrel leſs when his friends miſtook him. What-ever other exerciſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction calls to, this is one, to ſearch out and be humbled for ſin; and it is a ſhrewd evidence, that that affliction is not bleſſed of God, that is not well Varniſhed with ſenſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>But 2ly. Not only is ſin the in-let to all afflictions, but even godly perſons pardoned of ſin, may be under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the account of ſin; I ſhall not ſpeak of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and abſolutely determined afflictions, as that all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men muſt die, and godly women muſt have pain in child-bearing, as well as others, but godly pardoned perſons may come under peculiar afflictions upon the account of ſin, and that either before ſin is committed, or after ſin is committed; Before ſin be committed, godly men may come under affliction upon the account of ſin. How many
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47356:79"/>
afflictions got godly men upon the account of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſpoſitions to prevent ſin, to withdraw them from their purpoſe, to hide pride from man, to keep back his ſoul from the pit, and his life from periſhing by the ſword? <hi>Job</hi> 33.17, 18. How many are ſuch hard Rocks, that they muſt have hard Wedges to rent them? How many are ſo prone to wandering, that were not their way hedged up with thorns, and the croſs laid in their way, they would ruine themſelves in following their lovers? How many would be intolerable to live with, if their noſe were not holden on the Grindſtone? How many are made beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, becauſe they cannot bear wealth? Thus ye ſee god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men may be put under the croſs with an eye to ſin to prevent ſin: Again, they may be brought under peculiar afflictions, upon the account of ſin, even when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that either before it be pardoned, or after it is pardoned. Before it be pardoned, as when a ſinner is lying under unrepented guilt, ſinging himſelf aſleep in his provocations. If a godly man with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. drive ſuch a Trade, to fall into ſcandalous ſins, and ly over in ſecurity, the Lord will ſend a hurl upon him, not to ſatisfie his juſtice, but to ſhake him out of his ſecure poſture, and to ſet him to his feet, to the exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and humiliation, he will ſend a rod, that he may hear the voice thereof, and who hath appointed it, Hence <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray;</hi> before I got the croſs I wandered, and knew not what I was doing, but now have I kept thy word: That's affliction upon the account of ſin committed, before it be pardoned, to waken out of ſecurity, and put to repent for it: again afflictions may come on the godly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſin, even when it is pardoned, when the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man falls in ſin, eſpecially if it be a ſcandalous ſin, he may not win eaſily away with that eſcape, but may be made to go with a born-down-back after it is pardoned,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47356:79"/>
all his days. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.12, 13. The Lord tells <hi>David,</hi> that he had pardoned him, yet that the ſword ſhould not depart from his houſe, for all that. We ſuppoſe the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were godly men, and pardoned for the abuſe of the Lords Supper, yet 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep. For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged. But when we are judged we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> Where ye may ſee affliction is let out upon the account of ſin remitted. And if ye aſk, Why doth the Lord ſo? I anſwer, not to take a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his juſtice, that's already compleatly made by Chriſt; but he doth it, partly to vindicat his own honour, whatever be betwixt him and his pardoned children, if they fall in ſin that the world obſerves, he will let the world ſee that he will not wink at their miſcarriages. The ſword's not departing from <hi>David</hi>'s houſe, was not to ſatisfie juſtice for his ſins that were pardoned, but becauſe by his ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous out-breaking, he had made the enemies to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme: He will let the world ſee, that if his darling <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> bourd with him, and fall in ſin, he hath made an ill bargain. Partly he doth this upon the account of ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that even the Saints who are pardoned may ſee yet more the bitterneſs of their folly and wandering. The Lord looketh not upon it as a ſufficient diſcovery of ſin, and the evil thereof, that a child of God may win to in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance antecedent to pardon, but when he is pardoned, he will ſharply afflict him, that he may know the bitterneſs of ſin, and that he made an ill bargain when he gave way to it; and upon this it will reſult, that when the Lord afflicts the pardoned, they are not to forget daily to be humbled for pardoned ſin. Though God be good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in pardoning ſin, we ſhould be ſevere on our ſelves for provoking him. Though the pardoned mans Count be cleared, he muſt ly in the duſt, for that he offended God,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47356:80"/>
and brought ſo much wo and vexation on himſelf. And further, this will follow upon it, that God by afflicting the pardoned ſinner, invites him to mortifie ſin daily that he may not fall in the like ſin again. Yea, and further, when he afflicts the ſinner, with an eye to ſin that is par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doned, he invites the ſinner to more and more thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him for the pardoning of it, when he conſiders what-ever afflictions or rods be inflicted, yet his pardon is enſured to him: Theſe are ſome of the bleſſed ends, why the Lord with an eye to pardoned ſin, is pleaſed to let out afflictions and chaſtiſements upon juſtified perſons; and it is upon this account, that chaſtiſement with pardon is put in the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32. That however he will not take his loving kindneſs from his children, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail, yet he will viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes; therefore we would mind this well. It is no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay, God chaſtens not the Saints at all upon the account of ſin; for they ſay, God ſees no ſin in them to chaſten; but let us not deceive our ſelves, but when the rod is laid on, let us <hi>hear the voice of the rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> Mic. 6.9. Ye have heard, that all afflictions comes in by the door of ſin, and therefore it's a ſweet ſtudy under afflictions, to be ſenſible of ſin. Ye have heard, that God may ſend afflictions on juſtified perſons, to prevent ſin, and to waken them out of ſecurity, and put them to repentance when ſin is committed, to imprint upon their ſpirits the folly of their wanderings, and the bitterneſs that follows ſin, to caution them for the future againſt relapſing in ſin, to ſtir them up to mortifie ſin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are better Leſſons than the dreams of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that God hath no reſpect to the ſins of his children when he afflicts them.</p>
            <p>And yet I ſhall add a third word more for Caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their error, that is, That Gods afflicting of Saints
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47356:80"/>
with an eye to ſin, doth not at all claſh with that which they aſſert, that the afflictions of the godly are for the trial of their faith. That they are meerly for the trial of their faith, we deny; that they are for the trial of their faith, we grant. For though afflictions be for the trial of faith, yet they are alſo for other ends, as before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to ſtir up to repentance, in order to pardon, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repentance to humble them, and caution againſt ſin, and for producing other effects, yet they are ſtill trials of faith, whether they will adhere to God; yea, ſo much the more trials of faith are they, as we have not only trouble to graple with, but guilt that brought on the affliction; It is eaſier for faith to hold its feet under a cleanly trial, than when affliction is lying on, and conſcience of guilt is ſtaring us in the face: And therefore we ſhall eaſily grant, providing the mind of God in other ends of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be not neglected; That when we have done all, we ſhould look on the trial of faith as a main end of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and when in affliction we caſt away confidence, we miſs a main end, and imped the good that we might get by affliction.</p>
            <p>The time having prevented me, and I cannot win to the other two Queſtions, whether the truth of pardon depends on the intimation of it to our hearts, and whether pardon be it revocable, ſo that guilt makes not former pardon void, though it needeth pardon, and ought to be mourned for. I ſhall not now break in upon them. The Lord bleſs his Word to you.</p>

            <p>Theſe general Heads on which I am now treating, they want not their ground in the Text and Context. That which is pardoned (to which I have ſpoken) the Text tells, that it is iniquity, there is forgivenneſs with thee of theſe iniquities, which if tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mark, who can ſtand? The Author of this benefit of pardon, is expreſly held out in the Text, <hi>There is forgivenneſs with thee;</hi> and the benefit it ſelf, the nature whereof I am now inquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is held out in that term of forgivenneſs, <hi>There is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenneſs with thee.</hi> Now concerning this, having clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed negatively, what it is not, I told you particularly, that pardon takes not away the filth and beeing of ſin, but the guilt of ſin. God in pardoning the ſinner, remits the offence done to him, by the violation of his Law, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the pardoned ſinner to his favour, and exempts him from the deſerved puniſhment of ſin; and in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this, I ſpoke to two of four Queſtions, which are needful to be diſcuſſed, for clearing the nature of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I cleared to you, that though guilt be inſeparable from the filth of ſin, yet the ſinner might be pardoned, though the filth of ſin remain; and how that his pardon did not take away the deſert of ſin, conſidered in it ſelf, but that it takes away that deſert and guilt, as it reſults on the perſon ſinning, ſo as it never taketh effect upon him; ſo that though the perſon fled unto Chriſt for refuge be troubled, not only with the pollution, but with the guilt of ſin, yet he needs not be afraid, for it takes no effect againſt him, ſince he has betaken himſelf to the City of Refuge. And to confirm this, I gave you ſeveral Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expreſſions of pardon, which may quiet the Conſcience,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47356:81"/>
and be ground of peace; that although the filth of ſin, and the inherent deſert of ſin remain, yet pardon is a real ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the pardoned ſinner. 2. Another caſe or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which I ſpoke unto, was, that ſeing pardon frees the pardoned man from obligation to puniſhment, whether or not doth, or may the Lord purſue a pardoned juſtified man with any chaſtiſement or puniſhment for ſin, and there, not to reſume what I ſpoke unto you the laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, I gave you ſome grounds of refutation of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctrine, who will have the fault or guilt remitted when the puniſhment is retained; which is to ſay, that ſin is remitted, and it's not remitted: And upon the other hand, I cleared to you againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> how that as all trouble came in by the door of ſin, and that the Lord may and doth chaſten the pardoned ſinner, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſin; partly to prevent ſin, partly to rouſe him up to repentance when he hath ſinned, partly to ſet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to their feet, that they may be rightly affected with ſin when it is pardoned, and that they may be excited to make a right uſe of pardon.</p>
            <p>There remains yet other two Queſtions or Caſes to be cleared, anen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the nature of remiſſion of ſin, to which I ſhall now briefly ſpeak, as the Lord will give.</p>
            <p>The 3d Caſe or Queſtion in order to this, whether the truth of pardon depends upon the intimation thereof to our hearts, yea, or no, ſo that when a ſenſible ſinner, fallen down at Gods foot-ſtool, in the confeſſion of ſin, and crying for pardon through Chriſt, yet he finds nothing like a pardon intimate to his Conſcience. In this caſe the Queſtion is, whether hath he ground to doubt, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he repented of ſin, nor gotten a pardon from God for it. The general Anſwer to this is, that pardon, and Gods intimation of pardon to the Conſcience, are not to be confounded. The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. gives a general rule concerning all ſupernatural gifts, that when
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47356:82"/>
we have received theſe things freely of God, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God. It's one thing to get theſe ſupernatural gifts gifted to us, another thing to get the ſpirit which is of God, to know they are given us; and this hath place particularly in the matter of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, for the pardon of ſin is a ſentence already paſt in the Word of God, in favours of all believers and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in Chriſt, ſo that no ſooner doth the penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner flee unto him, and look unto him, as to the brazen ſerpent, for pardon and cure, but as ſoon that pardon becomes his, before he can ſubſume and ſay, I am fled unto Chriſt for pardon, and am pardoned, his direct act of faith draws out pardon, before he can reflect and paſs a judgment on that his pardon. And hence, when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> hath pronounced, that <hi>David</hi>'s ſin is pardoned him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. Yet in the 51. Pſalm he crys inſtantly for mercy, for pardon, and blotting out of his tranſgreſſion. Why? Though he was pardoned in the Court of Heaven, yet he was not pardoned in the Court of his own Conſcience. The intimation of pardon was ſuſpended and kept up. And hence is that which I named before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> It's one benefit to him to have his ſins forgiven him, and another benefit to be of good chear on that account: Therefore, as Chriſt tells him, that his ſins are forgiven him, ſo he muſt bid him be of good chear. Thus ye ſee the truth of a penitents pardon depends not on the intimation thereof to his conſcience.</p>
            <p>But this wakens up another Caſe or Queſtion; the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing forth whereof will deduce this more diſtinctly, and that is, how it comes, and for what ends it is, that a child of God cannot get it diſcerned and cloſed with, that he is pardoned. For clearing of this Caſe, we ſhould look
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47356:82"/>
firſt to our ſelves, and then to a wiſe hand of God, ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the intimation of pardon. If we look to our ſelves when we are pardoned, we cannot diſcern it becauſe of our weakneſs, that cannot diſcern our happineſs; we are blind and diſcern not our happineſs, diſcern not our health, we confound the reality of pardon, with the ſenſe and feeling of pardon, and we will not believe pardon, except we feel the effects of pardon; and it is alſo becauſe we are ignorant of getting pardon through the ſatisfaction of another: when we are brought to be ſenſible for ſin, and to look to Chriſt for pardon, and God hath ſpoken par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, we are like the Sea, which being raiſed by a ſtorm, doth tumble a while after the ſtorm is over, and there is a calm. Theſe are ſome hints on our part, why the pardoned ſinner gets it not diſcerned that he is pardoned: But if we look up to God, he may have a holy hand in keeping up the intimation of pardon upon ſeveral accounts. As 1. The Lord would have us looking more to his Word, wherein pardon in the Goſpel is holden out to us on Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-terms, and leſs to ſenſe, he would breed us to grip the promiſe while ſenſe come, and to grip the promiſe that ſenſe may come; and they that will ſuſpend all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of pardon, while it be ſenſibly intimat; the Lord in his holy providence keeps up the intimation of pardon from them, to teach them to pay more due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Word, and to ſeek and feed upon the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that depends upon pardon promiſed and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therein, that by following his method by faith, they may come to ſenſible intimation of pardon. 2. The Lord may keep up the ſenſible intimation of pardon from the penitent and pardoned man, that he may learn him to look upon pardon not as a neceſſary reſult and effect of his repentance, but as a free gift of God, which though the Lord will not beſtow without repentance, yet he doth not beſtow it for repentance; therefore doth he ſuſpend
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47356:83"/>
the intimation of pardon from the penitent man, that he may learn to look leſs to his Repentance, and more to the free Grace of God in obtaining of Pardon. 3. The Lord ſees it fit to keep pardoned ſinners in ſuſpence, as to the ſenſe of Pardon, or the intimation of it, that he may let them ſee, that when he is provocked by their ſinning, it is not ſo eaſie to recover themſelves, and get into his favour; Therefore though he have pardoned them, yet he will keep them at the back of the door, as to the intimation of it; partly, that they may be put to reſent how bitter a thing it is to depart from God, and to raiſe a Cloud betwixt him and them; and partly, that they may be affrighted to dally with ſin again; he will have them to know, that though he give them mercy, it is not ſo eaſie to bring a Delinquent in Court and Favour again. And, 4. The Lord keeps up the intimation of pardon from the penitent and pardoned ſinner, for this among other ends, that he may be fit for ſympathy with others, that may come in the like caſe with himſelf, he may cauſe his reconciled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple feel the bitterneſs of departing from him, and may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to ly in the ſenſe, and under fears of their un-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled condition, as to the intimation of pardon, that they may bear burden with others that come to be in their caſe. 5. The Lord keeps up the intimation of pardon from them, that he may ſet them on work to repent more, that they may ſearch out ſin more, and repent more for their ſin, and for the ſinfulneſs that is in their ſin, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as yet they have not laid well to heart. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuſpending the intimation of pardon, even where pardon is really paſt, were they well pondered by us, we might get a better account of our pardon, and the petitions we put up for it.</p>
            <p>And particularly to ſpeak a word here to them, who though they are in the uſe of the Means, running to the open Fountain, and ſeriouſly to know the mind of God, as to the pardon of their ſin, and their being in favour
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47356:83"/>
with God, and yet can find no intimation thereof; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide what general Directions they may gather from that which I have ſpoken, I ſhall offer three or four words fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thou that art a ſenſible ſinner, in the uſe of the Means, fleeing to the Remedy, yet can find no warmneſs or ſweetneſs, through gripping to the Promiſe of pardon, thou finds nothing like that, <hi>Son, or daughter, be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee:</hi> For ſuch, I ſay, as thou art, I offer theſe four words of Direction: 1. I would have ſuch perſons looking upon it as a mercy, that they are not deluded as to the matter of their pardon, as many are who never doubt of it: I confeſs they are in an error on the one hand; but the error of the other hand, that doubts not of pardon, is the more dangerous; thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing doubting, is diſhonourable to God, and thou impedes, and provocks him to ſuſpend thy comfort: but the other that doubts not of pardon, they are deluded, they take it for granted, that they are pardoned, or deſperatly they will take their venture whether they be pardoned or not; and therefore thou that are keeped in exerciſe about the intimation of pardon, ought to bleſs God that thou art not in the error of theſe ſelf-deluders. 2. I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to ſuch, that they would juſtifie God whatever he do; That is <hi>David</hi>'s remark, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>That he might be juſtified when he ſpeaks, and clear when he judges;</hi> if thou fall a carping and quarrelling, that will not ſhorten thy diſtreſs, it may well provock God to hide his Face yet more, till thou learn to juſtifie him. 3. I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them that are about the Means uſing for pardon, and yet cannot win to the intimation of it, that they would look well to their Repentance, and there are four things to be looked to in Repentance: 1. They would look well that it be ſincere, that it be repentance for ſin as ſin, and not a ruing for it, as it is diſgraceful to them and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; many beguile themſelves with a ruing for ſin, and never repent ſin. 2. They would look if their repentance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47356:84"/>
be univerſal for all ſin, which is another mark of ſincere repentance, ſee that thou be not ſeeming to rue over one ſin, while thou art hugging another in thy boſom. 3. They would labour to have their repentance deep and through, I mean not to recommend to any a trade of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but any who reads in what plight <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. They will readily find, that the repentance of the generality is not through. And 4. They would look to it if their repentance be conſtant. It is marked of Chriſt, That <hi>when he was in an agony, he prayed more earnestly, Luk.</hi> 22.44. So ſuch as are ſuſpended and keeped at the door; while they are about the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they would be more fervent, and hold on in the work of repentance. 4 That they would ſtick well by Faith. There is a word to this purpoſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50 10. <hi>who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light;</hi> no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of comfort, <hi>Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God:</hi> In this caſe, Faith cloſing with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of pardon, muſt be ſtuck by, and to help you to ſtick by Faith in ſuch an exigent, I would have you conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partly, that many a Pardon is paſt in Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſenſible ſinner wants the comfort. 2. When Faith is the exerciſe that thou haſt no will to make uſe of, I would have thee to conſider, that it is a notable refutation of temptation, to go and mourn over thy Atheiſm and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and for that thou has ſuch an averſation to the way of Faith, whereby only thou can win to the Shore. And 3. Conſider that it is a moſt cleanly and noble Act of Faith, in deſpite of Satans Temptations, and the Fears of thine own Conſcience, over the belly of Unbelief, to caſt thy ſelf in the arms of Chriſt, and in the boſom of the Promiſe, and if thou periſh, thou periſh: There thou caſts thy ſelf, and there thou leaves thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the Fourth, or laſt Caſe or Queſtion, I propoſed to be ſpoken to, <hi>Whether pardon of ſin be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47356:84"/>
or irrevocable ſentence?</hi> That is, whether when a pardoned ſinner falleth in a new ſin, his new guilt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all former pardon till he repent all over again, and get a renewed pardon for all. It is to no purpoſe here to trouble you with the differences betwixt the <hi>Cannoniſts,</hi> and the School-men, betwixt <hi>Gratian</hi> and his <hi>Gloſſator</hi> in this matter. That which lies in our plain road in clearing this Queſtion, I ſhall reduce to five brief Aſſertions; And 1. It is to be granted, and experience witneſſeth it, that in the caſe of new guilt, Satan by temptation may be ready to caſt all looſe, to call in queſtion all former pardons, ſo to a mans ſenſe, all former iniquities may come to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and it may come in queſtion, whether or not they have been pardoned, which is a proof of the Saints tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though it be clogged with a miſtake, their pardon may fall under debate, as we may ſee in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job;</hi> in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 15.7. Who prays <hi>that God would not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſins of his youth:</hi> and in <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. Whoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the ſins of my youth.</hi> He looks on ſins long ago pardoned, as purſued by God. 2. It is to be granted, that as Satan by temptation, and Saints through their own weakneſs, may bring former pardon in queſtion; ſo the Lord in his Providence may ſee it good to concur in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like that, he may, though he do not recal pardon yet bring pardoned ſins to memory, open theſe un-ripe Graves, and hold their heads over them, when they fall in the committing of new folly. And this the Lord doth partly that he may affect the ſinner the more, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on his guilt againſt God, that hath pardoned him ſo; and partly, that the ſinner may thereby be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to vomit up by repentance his new contracted guilt, all terrors for former guilt recurring, he may not dally therewith any more; and partly he calls former guilt to remembrance, that he may make the ſinner afraid to be adding to that Accompt. 3. This is a thing to be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47356:85"/>
to, that is, That however it ſtand with a man as to the pardon of bygone ſin, yet God allows him no conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the pardon of ſin, ſo long as he wallows in new provocations without repentance; be his pardon revock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or not revockable, it ſhall be all a matter to him, if he ſtudy not tenderneſs in his walk; and any man that is going on in new provocations, &amp; doth bleſs himſelf in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pardon, I ſhall not ſay that he is bleſſing himſelf with a lie, but ſure he is bleſſing himſelf with a falſe comfort in his right hand. 4. This muſt be granted, that as the School-men ſay, That ſins that are pardoned do recur up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the commiſſion of new guilt, not formally conſidered as in themſelves; but in ſo far as theſe former ſins that were pardoned, and virtually contained in the ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that is in that new guilt; that is, though formerly pardoned ſins return not upon the Delinquent, yet there is ſo much of ingratitude to God in new contracted guilt, that in ſome reſpect the ſinner may be accounted no leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if all the former guilt were contained in that one provocation. But when theſe four muſt be granted, yet in the 5th place it is ſtill to be held, That a pardon paſt by God, is a ſentence irrevocable; it is a ſentence not made void, nor cancelled by any new guilt. It is one of theſe Gifts of God that are given without Repentance, and this is clearly intimat to you in theſe Scriptures that I gave you before, while I ſhew you how ſatisfactorily, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of the pardon of ſin, as it is looked on by God; how it is called <hi>a blotting out of ſin, a covering of it, a putting of it out of his ſight, a caſting of it behind his back, and in the depth of the ſea;</hi> and ſo, <hi>as though it be ſought for, it ſhall not be found:</hi> and how ſpeaking of pardoned iniquities, he ſays, <hi>He ſo blots them out, that he does not remember them;</hi> and <hi>he will forgive their iniquities ſo, as that he will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſin no more.</hi> Theſe Scriptures evince, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don once paſt, is irrevocable. As for theſe Scriptures the Cannoniſts and Lutherians urge, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. <hi>That
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47356:85"/>
when a righteous man turneth away from his righteouſneſs and commits iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations of a wicked man, all his righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned, he ſhall die in his ſin.</hi> That would ſeem to make all void, but the anſwer is eaſie, That either the Text ſpeaks of a Temporary Righteouſneſs of a man that was never pardoned, and from which he may totally and finally fall away: Or if it ſpeak of true righteouſneſs in the pardoned man, it holds only by way of ſuppoſition, That <hi>if the righteous man ſhould fall away, his righteouſneſs ſhould not be mentioned;</hi> and this ſuppoſition ſays nothing to the poſſibility of the thing, but is a bleſſed mean to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his falling away. There is another word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32. ſpoken <hi>of the wicked ſervant that had his debt forgiven him, and had no compaſſion on his fellow ſervant, and was delivered to the tormentors,</hi> that the Antients trouble themſelves much about, and ſpeak of a Baptiſmal Remiſſion, that is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Baptiſm; but that Text is a Parable, and a Parable is not to be ſtrained beyond its ſcope. Parables are like pictures wherein are many flouriſhes, which are not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of the thing Portrayed. The ſcope of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is, to prove that Chriſt will pardon the ſins of none, but ſuch as forgive others; and ſuch as will not forgive others, though they ſeem pardoned folk, they will find their ſins retained; and that this is the ſcope, is clear from Chriſt's Explaining it, and no more.</p>
            <p>From this that I have been ſpeaking about the irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableneſs of pardon, there is ſome <hi>Uſes</hi> that I intended to have ſpoken to, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall name and cloſe; one is, That as they who have been pardoned, and can reflect how much they have been humbled for particular ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they attained to pardon, they would walk tenderly for fear of wakening old ſores, and that guilt that God hath covered with the vail of Pardon, and as they would not have theſe laid in their Diſh, and be made to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe unripe Graves of Abominations. And another
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47356:86"/>
word that I intended to have ſpoken to, is, That a ſenſible Child of God, though he fall in new guilt, is not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look upon former guilt, which hath been pardoned, as un-pardoned, though he ought to be humbled for, and repent the preſent guilt; if Sathan, and the Conſcience, and God in his holy Providence, call to remembrance ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and waken them about his ears; the ſenſible man in that caſe ſhould not queſtion former pardon, though readily there is ſome unpardoned ſin, where theſe bygone compts are back-ſpeared, that ſhould be ſought out and mourned for; yet all are not to be looked on as unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but as beacons and warnings, to make Conſcience of repentance for unpardoned ſin, that we may get that breach ſemented, and that wound bound up again. God bleſs what ye have heard.</p>

            <p>I Did in the forenoon put a cloſe to the third and main Head of Doctrine, that is contained and included in this high and great Priviledge of the Remiſſion of ſins, and that is to clear what this forgiveneſs is, and wherein the nature of it conſiſts, and what ye heard upon it in the morning, amounts to this, That Pardon in the Court of Heaven, is a diſtinct thing from the intimation of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the Court of Conſcience; and therefore they that are running to the Fountain, and laying hold upon the Promiſe of Pardon, they muſt not conceive that they are not pardoned, becauſe they cannot feel by any ſenſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation that they are pardoned. And the laſt thing I was upon was, That however pardon paſt by God is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable, it is a Deed and Sentence that is never revock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; once be pardoned of ſin, and it is eternally pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47356:86"/>
And conſequently the Child of God that hath been at Chriſt the Remedy with any ſin, he muſt not conceive that every ſin that troubles him, eſpecially upon his falling in new guilt, is unpardoned; yet they that know how much they are in Free Graces Debt for Pardon, would walk tenderly, that they open not theſe unripe Graves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, which will be much bitterneſs to them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when new guilt is made a proſpect, where through to read old guilt, though it be pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> proceed to the 4. Head to be ſpoken to in this purpoſe, and <hi>that is the time when God pardoneth ſin in his people.</hi> The Text hath a ground for this alſo; for the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> finds it a fit time to ſtrick in for pardoning Mercy, and by Faith to cloſe with this, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee:</hi> When he is abaſed with the ſight and ſenſe of ſin, when he finds ſin ſuch a Debt, ſuch a Burden, <hi>That if God mark iniquity, none can ſtand,</hi> he finds it then time, I ſay, to ſtrick in for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But that I may ſpeak a little more diſtinctly to this, which when I have done with, there will remain only the right method of application of Pardon to be ſpoken to, that will bring me on in the Text, and to the practical <hi>Uſe</hi> of all this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> I ſhall ſpeak briefly to theſe three Queſtions on it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether ſin be pardoned from all eternity, or when Chriſt paid ſatisfaction to Juſtice on the Croſs, as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſing that ſin is pardoned not from eternity, but in time; The next Queſtion will be, Whether all ſins be forgiven at once to the juſtified and pardoned man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Juſtification, and upon a mans cloſing with Chriſt, all ſins, not only ſins paſt and preſent, but ſins to come are actually pardoned?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If ſins be pardoned in time, How is it ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 30 19, 20. <hi>To be done at the day of Judgment? Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47356:87"/>
the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe Queſtions, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> make Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and the Pardon of ſin an imminent Act in God (as they call it) and they will have it paſt from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and they aſſert, That all the Elect are actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned from eternity, and the loweſt that any of them come is, That they will have all the Elect pardoned, when Chriſt upon the Croſs finiſhed the ſatisfaction to Juſtice for their ſins, and all that a Believer gets, when he comes to Chriſt, and cloſes with Chriſt for Righteouſneſs and Life, is not an actual pardon, but the intimation and declaration of his pardon, even as when a pardoned Rebel who hath a pardon in his pocket, is brought in before the King, and prays for pardon, and the King intimats the pardon, which he hath already got, unto him; To clear it according to Scripture, and ſo to lead you to ſomething practical in this, ye ſhall take up pardon in four ſteps.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We grant, That from all eternity God Decreed to pardon the ſins of all the Elect, and in this reſpect we ſhall not decline to ſay, that all the Elect are Juſtified and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in God's Decree, to whom <hi>known are all his works from the beginning of the world, Act.</hi> 15.18. Yet we muſt add, that that will not prove actual Pardon to the Elect from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for all the Elect are ſaved as well as pardoned in God's Decree; and yet they are not actually ſaved till they be glorified. There is only a Decree concerning their Pardon to be in due time paſt, on Goſpel Terms, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Pardon is a tranſient Act, and changes the ſtate of the perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Pardon to the Elect is Decreed from all eternity, ſo it is purchaſed by Chriſt at his Death, for then, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us,</hi> which was contrair to us, <hi>and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs:</hi> He then blotted out our Libel and Dittay; how? by paying a price for that pardon, that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47356:87"/>
in due time, and in the uſe of means, was to be actually conferred, and in this ſenſe we ſhall let it paſs, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect were juſtified in Chriſt their Head, at his Death, he took up that Song, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.8. <hi>He is near that juſtifies me, who will contend with me,</hi> that we might ſing it after him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a third ſtep of the pardon of ſin, that is, That pardon that is Decreed by God from eternity, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt at his Death, it is recorded by way of a paſt Sentence, and tendered in the word of the Goſpel, to be imbraced by ſinners in due order, in the uſe of the means. A ſentence of pardon is paſt and pronounced in the word of the Goſpel, that needs no more to make it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the ſinner, but his cloſing with Chriſt, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his name in the due uſe of the Means.</p>
            <p>But yet we muſt add a fourth ſtep, when pardon is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, when Chriſt has purchaſt padon, and the Sentence of pardon is paſt and pronounced in the Word; yet no man is actually pardoned till he come unto Chriſt, till he be actually penitent and a Believer, he is not actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and when he is an actual penitent, and has cloſed with Chriſt for pardon of ſin, righteouſneſs and Life, he may then look back with comfort on Gods Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, on Chriſt's purchaſe of pardon, on his being on Gods Heart, when pardon is holden out in the Word, but actually pardoned he is not, till he himſelf come to Chriſt, and be a Believer on him.</p>
            <p>Many things would fall in to be ſpoken to for clearing of this; ſome whereof will come in when we come to the Reſolution of the next Queſtion; I ſhall here offer three words for clearing and confirming this Truth:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That all the Elect before Converſion are in a ſtate of Wrath even as others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. The Elect before they be quickned are Children of Wrath, not in their own ſenſe only, as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay, but really even as others, and conſequently they were not pardoned, nor reconciled
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47356:88"/>
before they were quickned more than the Pagans, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is clear from the Tenor of the Scriptures, that they are not, nor cannot be juſtified and pardoned, till they be in Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> not in a decree, or judicially as repreſented by Chriſt, but actually by Faith, for we are <hi>juſtified by faith, Rom.</hi> 5.7. and conſequently by Faith we are pardoned, which is a Branch of Juſtification; now men are in Chriſt by Faith, not from eternity, but in time, and on that account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Paul</hi> tells of ſome of his kinſmen that were in Chriſt before him, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not actually pardoned till they were in him by Faith.</p>
            <p>And 3. In the pattern of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. We are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pray daily, <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we alſo forgive our debtors;</hi> The <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay, when we are bidden Pray for forgiveneſs, that it is for the intimation of pardon but that Gloſs may be eaſily wiped off, if we conſider that we are to pray for <hi>forgiveneſs, as we forgive others.</hi> Now we forgive others by a real paſſing from the wrong they have done us, and nor by the intimation of pardon only. And further it may be cleared from that ſame ſimilitude, that <hi>Antinomians</hi> bring of a Rebel or Malefactor, that hath gotten a pardon from his Prince; it is true, after he hath gotten his pardon, when he comes before his Prince, he may ſeek the intimation of his pardon; but he were a fool if as oft as he came in his Princes preſence, he ſhould ſeek the Intimation of his pardon; and conſequently it is not the intimation of pardon that is to be ſought daily in that Petition, but actual pardon; Thus ye ſee that ſin is not actually pardoned from eternity: This might warn us in our practice to take a right look of the Decrees of God. Profane Mockers begin there to caſt off all fear of God, and if (ſay they) it be decreed in Heaven, they will get it; and if not, they want it; others that are more tender are ready to queſtion if they be decreed for Life, and if Chriſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47356:88"/>
ſtood in their room, and if they have intereſt in his death; but theſe are not thy firſt Queſtions, but if thou haſt need of him, if that which thou miſters be held our in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and thou needeſt never ſpeir thy intereſt, ſo long as thou haſt a neceſſity to prove it; till thou begin there, a comfortable look of Gods Decree and purpoſe about thee thou will never get.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the ſecond Queſtion, whether all ſins of the juſtified be forgiven at once; The expreſſions of ſome orthodox Divines run this way, that Juſtification being an indiviſible inſtantaneous act, all the ſins of the juſtified, paſt, preſent, and to come, are pardoned in that firſt act of Juſtification, and all that we get afterward is a renewed ſenſe of our Juſtification, and a renewed extract of our Diſcharge, when by new guilt it is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſubdued, ſo as we cannot read it. In the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, a general truth is to be granted, that when a man is once juſtified, no ſin that he falls in after Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall eventually condemn him; for if we conſider partly the ſure decree of God, that he will ſave his own elect whom he hath decreed to ſave; partly the purchaſe of Chriſt, that he will loſe none that are given to him; and partly the ſure ſtate of the juſtified man, that as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he juſtifies, them he alſo glorifies;</hi> we may aſſert when once a man is juſtified, he ſhall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, though he fall in new ſins after Juſtification: But this we ſay not upon that account, becauſe theſe ſins are pardoned, but becauſe the elect juſtified man ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly repent and get pardon, and theſe are the terms on which we ſay, that no ſin the juſtified man falls in, ſhall eventually condemn him. But more particularly, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juſtification, and the pardon of ſin, ye ſhall in the taking of it up, go along with me in theſe four or five ſteps.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:47356:89"/>1. A juſtified man, cloſing with Chriſt by faith, his perſon is reconciled and received in favour with God; and that is the firſt great ſtep or benefit the juſtified perſon hath, the man with <hi>Abraham</hi> becomes a friend of God of an enemy, and upon this reſults that diſtinction that is to be made betwixt a mans ſtate and his condition. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed man, both his ſtate and condition are curſed, but the juſtified, as to his ſtate is bleſſed, but his condition may alter as the Moon upon his hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Juſtification, not only is the juſtified mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taken in favour with God, but all his ſins paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, all the debt wherewith he can be charged in that day when he cloſes with Chriſt, are blotted out and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, no more to be remembred; and his pardon is this, when he grips by faith to Chriſt, and thorow Chriſt to the promiſe of pardon holden forth in the Goſpel, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is a pronounced ſentence in the Word, and all his crimes and tranſgreſſions are then done away.</p>
            <p>But 3. Becauſe a juſtified man is not a perfect man, but falling daily in new eſcapes, whereby he contracts new guilt and pollution, therefore a juſtified man, beſide the reconciliation of his perſon, and the pardon of his ſins he is under for the time, he hath a right to that open <hi>fountain opened in the houſe of David for ſin and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Zech. 13.1. He hath a right to go to the fountain, as an open fountain to waſh, upon his repentance daily, as he contracts pollution, and that's another priviledge the juſtified man hath, that he hath a fountain to go to upon his repentance, and waſh and be clean.</p>
            <p>And 4. This is another benefit that reſults on Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that not only hath the juſtified man a right to the fountain, but a promiſe of repentance, to fit and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him to go to the open Fountain, and make uſe of it for cleanſing, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.9, 10. That God will pour upon him the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, and cauſe him to look
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47356:89"/>
unto him whom he hath pierced by his ſins, and mourn, he hath Chriſt an exalted Prince and Saviour to give him repentance, and remiſſion of ſins, and that is another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the juſtified man, that not only is he in favour with God, and hath a right to pardon, but a right to the promiſe of repentance, that he may have acceſs to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Fountain for pardon.</p>
            <p>Yet we muſt add 5thly, That his ſins to come are not actually pardoned, till he actually come to the Fountain and waſh: It's true (as the learned ſpeak) Juſtification is an indiviſible inſtantaneous act, without ſucceſſion (as they call it) as to the ſtate of the juſtified mans perſon, but yet as to the pardon of daily ſins, as it is ſaid in the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith, Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. God doth continue to forgive the ſins of theſe that are juſtified; It's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued act, a frequently repeated act, as the juſtified man falls in new ſins, humbles himſelf, and confeſſeth, begs pardon, and renews his faith and repentance.</p>
            <p>And to clear that it is ſo, I ſhall adduce two or three Arguments briefly, which will alſo prove that ſins are not forgiven from eternity; and paſſing that Argument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. where, becauſe we are daily ſinning, we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſeek daily pardon and forgivenneſs, as we forgive others, ye ſhall conſider theſe three things, to make it out, That ſins to come are not actually pardoned in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, That ſin muſt be committed, and be a crime, before it be pardoned; common ſenſe ſays, that before a pardon be, there muſt be a crime, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſins to come are not pardoned, they not being as yet crimes. Hence when the Scripture ſpeaks of pardon of ſins, it ſpeaks of theſe ſins as committed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.22. <hi>All his tranſgreſſions that he hath done ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8. <hi>And I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity, whereby they have ſinned againſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47356:90"/>
me, and I will pardon all their iniquities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have ſinned, and whereby they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> Nay, the very names given to the pardon of ſin, as when it is called, the blotting out of ſin, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it out of his ſight, the caſting of it in the depth of the Sea, the remembring of it no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe, and the like, import an exiſtence and beeing of ſin, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the pardon of ſin. What need is there of a pardon to that which is not a crime? Is not exiſtent, hath not a beeing? Nay, there is no Prince, nor Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the world, that will give pardon at that rate; it's fair enough if the delinquent get pardon when he hath committed a crime, and conſequently, God pardons no ſins, till they be committed, to juſtified perſons.</p>
            <p>A 2d Argument that inclines me to think, that all ſins are not pardoned in Juſtification, is this, that there is no pardon of ſin, but upon confeſſion of ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> There is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin promiſed, but upon repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give</hi> firſt <hi>repentance to Iſrael, and</hi> then <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins:</hi> Where God gives remiſſion, he gives firſt repentance. Now confeſſion of ſin, and repentance for a ſin, hath no place where ſin hath not a beeing; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin, and repentance for ſin, preſuppoſes the beeing of ſin, and the ſinners reflecting on it, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>And a 3d Conſideration or Argument is, when ſins are actually pardoned, a man may rejoyce, exult and boaſt in God, upon the account of pardon. O how may the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſinner exceedingly rejoyce in God? But who dare ſay, that a juſtified perſon, while recking in his ſin (to ſpeak ſo) before he hath confeſſed it, and repented for it, can, or dare rejoice in God? Shall he, while he is wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47356:90"/>
in his abominations, rejoyce in God? That were abominable Doctrine, and yet he might in that caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, if theſe Abominations were pardoned before they were committed; nay more it would confound all diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be put betwixt unrepented and repented guilt; if a mans ſins were pardoned before they were committed, his pardon would be as ſure, as if he had repented, by their Doctrine: Therefore I conclude, that ſin cannot be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pardoned before it be committed, repented, and Chriſt fled unto for pardon.</p>
            <p>And this hath a practical <hi>Uſe,</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> but touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the great Practical <hi>Uſe</hi> of all is but coming) That juſtified folk that are at peace with God, as to the ſtate of their perſons, would not think light of their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlips into faults; thou art lying under thy daily failings, as a debt, till thou go to the open Fountain and waſh; It is true (as I ſaid before) no ſin thou falls in ſhall even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually condemn thee, but thou art a guilty perſon ſo long as thou lies under unrepented guilt; Therefore look to it, and let your Faith of Pardon be ſeen in your tenderneſs under new guilt; O that the Goſpel would take you off the Laws hand, and preſs you to this tenderneſs, that love to Chriſt, and the love of Chriſt might incite you in your actings, and when ye fall in ſin, to run to the Remedy, in the exerciſe of Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p>And to encourage you to this, another word reſults on this, That ye may help your ſelves to repent for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar failings, ye would hold a faſt grip of your reconciled ſtate; remember what I ſaid in the morning, that new guilt makes not void former pardon; ſo I ſay now, that new guilt makes not void your reconciled ſtate; ye may go to God, not as an Enemy to his Prince, but as a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Child to his Father for pardon; acceſs ye have to the open Fountain, ye coming humbled for ſin, and making uſe of Chriſt for renewed pardon, and if ye do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Priviledge, it will be a terrible ingredient in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47356:91"/>
your Dittay, when God comes to deal with your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>The 3d. Queſtion is, How can any pardon be ſaid to be paſt within time, ſeing <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19, 20. It is ſaid, <hi>our ſins are to be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord?</hi> There will then be a blotting out, and Diſcharge of ſins once for all, a Diſcharge open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, accompanied with all the conſequences of the Diſcharge. Sins pardoned here, will then be openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be pardoned; I find not only among the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but our reformed Divines, a Queſtion agitat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ſins will be ripped up in the Day of Judgment?</hi> A queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on needleſly ſtated; but what will not curioſity meddle with? but whether ſins will be then ripped up, to let it be ſeen what ſort of perſons he glorifies; or covered, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their ſins ſhall not then put them to ſhame, who are pardoned, though they ſhould everlaſtingly remember them; They ſhall alſo ſing in the remembrance of pardon; and though they ſhould be ripped up, yet not to their ſhame and confuſion; The conſolation of pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and all the effects of it; and the love of Chriſt will make them look upon their miſeries, as upon the occaſion of their being made everlaſtingly happy with him; but the time being ended, I ſhall go no further. God bleſs his Word to you, for Chriſts ſake.</p>

            <p>I Am now drawing towards a cloſe of this great Point concerning the Remiſſion of Sins; having now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at ſome length to that which is more Doctrinal in it; (this day I purpoſe (the Lord aſſiſting) to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is more particular: I have ſpoken to you,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47356:91"/>
1. Of the thing pardoned, <hi>Sin and iniquity.</hi> 2. Of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of pardon, <hi>God, with whom forgiveneſs is.</hi> 3. Of the nature of pardon, and what is imported in this <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> in the Text, and the laſt day in the afternoon, I came in the fourth place to ſpeak of the time when pardon of ſin is conferred, where ye heard, that neither are the ſins of the Elect actually pardoned from eternity, nor when Chriſt paid ſatisfaction to Juſtice for them on the Croſs, as <hi>Antinomians</hi> aſſert; neither are the Elect Juſtified and pardoned of all their ſins paſt, preſent and to come at Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as ſome Orthodox Divines incline to think; but their future ſins, or ſins to come after Juſtification, are not actually pardoned, till they be committed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and Chriſt fled into, and as the Fountain to waſh away their ſins, made uſe of.</p>
            <p>I was cut ſhort by time from ſpeaking to another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; That is, How pardon of ſin is conferred in Time, ſince the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19, 20, Tells of <hi>a blotting out of ſins</hi> to penitents, <hi>when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, when Chriſt ſhall come again to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I ſhall but touch a little on this, and ſhall go on; It is certain, that the blotting out of the ſins of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified at the Day of Judgment, does not contradict their being pardoned now; nay more, There is no ſin blotted out at that great Day, or openly declared to be blotted out and pardoned, and the Elect aſſoiled from it; but theſe which are pardoned in this life; Only there are four things to be noticed in the blotting out of ſin then, that heightens the advantage of the blotting out of ſin here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we inſiſt on the words of the Text, there is there at that Great Day, <hi>a blotting out of ſin,</hi> not only in the guilt of it, but in the filth and pollution of it. Here (as ye heard) however Sanctification be taking ſin to task in every pardoned man, yet the tender man ſenſible of ſin cannot but be affected when he finds ſin in the pollution of it to remain, though it be not reigning, though it hath not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47356:92"/>
the Throne; but then with the publick Declaration of pardon, there ſhall no blot of ſin, no ſpot, no wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing remain, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. There ſhall no ſcar be left of theſe wounds, that ſin hath made, which the pardoned ſinner may bear about with him while he is here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. While the godly are here, though they get frequently pardon of ſin, yet they have ſtill need of new pardon; they muſt be pardoned over and over again, and as often as they get their daily bread, they muſt as often ſeek the pardon of their ſins daily; but the blotting out of ſin in that Day, ſhall be a Declaration of the Pardon of ſin ſo fully, that there ſhall be no need of a reiterat pardon; they will then ſin no more, nor be in hazard of ſinning, and will have no more need of the open Fountain, whereunto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned man while he is here, muſt continually reſort with his foul feet to get them waſhen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The pardon of ſin here is not only Tranſacted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the ſinner, without the knowledge of the World; but it is oft-times keeped up from the ſenſe and feeling of the man that has gotten it. A man that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned may be keeped in fears, as if he were not pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a man that hath his Bonds taken off him, may be as if he were ſtill bound: But in that Day, the Pardon of Sin ſhall be publickly declared in the audience of Men, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Devils; and the pardoned mans pardon will be proclaimed and perfected, in the ſenſe and feeling of the pardoned man, the Court of Heaven, and the Court of the Conſcience, will ſay both one thing, and there will not be a demur in the one, about what is paſt in the other, as now often there is.</p>
            <p>And 4. Though ſin be pardoned, yet the effects and conſequences of pardon, are not at all times let out on the pardoned man here, he may be not only keeped under Deſertion, but he may be under Chaſtiſement on ſeveral accounts, (as I cleared to you before) though he may
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47356:92"/>
ſay (as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.) <hi>Now we are the ſons of God,</hi> but he muſt add, <hi>it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be;</hi> but in that day, pardon ſhall not only be proclaimed, and perfected in the Conſcience of the man, but all the effects and conſequences of pardon, ſhall flow out like a River upon him; <hi>Then ſighing and ſorrow ſhall flee away, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon his head,</hi> and in his heart; and theſe ſtripes that here were neceſſary for the back of fools, ſhall ceaſe, and his pardon ſhall be written in that bleſſed Sentence, <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee what is imported in that <hi>blotting out of ſin at the great day;</hi> and from it I ſhall ſhortly recommend to you two words in order to practice; one is, That this may be a ſtrong motive to you, to make pardon of ſin here ſure, when ye conſider that it hath ſuch bleſſed effects hereafter; the rich fruit and incomes of thy fleeing to Chriſt for pardon here, may ſeem to thee (as we uſe to ſpeak) to be far from the Sheaff; but there is a day co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, when the advantage of it will be made known to Men, Angels and Devils, their Conviction; what it is to have pardon for ſin? Thou that gets a pardon here, may be looked upon as an uncouth, unknown body but thou carries about with thee a Treaſure, that in that day will be found a Treaſure indeed. And therefore 2ly. Ye that are fled unto Chriſt for pardon, and have gotten par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don believed, and now and then ye are feeling ſome of the fruits of pardon, it ſhould quicken you to long for that day, wherein the effects, fruits and conſequences of that pardon will be fully diſplayed, and let out on pardoned ſinners. It it no wonder that a pardoned man long to be home, when he conſiders what a mercy pardon of ſin will be found to be, when it is laid in broad-band in that day.</p>
            <p>But now I come to the 5. general Head I propoſed to be ſpoken to, and that is, To clear up to you the right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of coming to cloſe with pardon, and for attaining of pardon; I have inſiſted to tell you what a rich priviledge
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47356:93"/>
pardon of ſin is. Now any that are not ſtupid and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, will ſay, how ſhall I be ſure of pardon, that I have cloſed with it, and win at it, and that I am not deluded in ſo great a concern? I have occaſionally hinted at the chief matter of theſe things, that I am to ſay upon this in the preceeding purpoſe, I ſhall now gather them together, and lay them in view before you, that ye may order your ſteps aright in cloſing with pardoning mercy; If I ſhould ſpeak to this in general, <hi>I</hi> find many things mentioned in Scripture to the obtaining of pardon, I find Faith, for we are ſaid <hi>to be juſtified by faith,</hi> and conſequently we are pardoned by Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>God hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> 2. I find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance often mentioned in this matter, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>John preached the baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The Apoſtles Doctrine was <hi>to preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins in his name. Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>Peters</hi> Doctrine is, <hi>Repent ye, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out. Act.</hi> 3.19. The counſel given to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is, <hi>Repent of thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee, Act.</hi> 8.22. 3. I find alſo Confeſſion of ſin mentioned in order to pardon of ſin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord, and thou forgav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> 4. I find confeſſing and forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin mentioned in order to pardon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall find mercy.</hi> 5. I find prayer alſo required in order to pardon of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. Chriſt bids the Diſciples pray, <hi>forgive us our debts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But that I may ſpeak to this purpoſe ſomewhat more diſtinctly, and ſo in effect take a view of this Text, and take in the 3d. thing I propoſed to be ſpoken to in it; I find that as the Apoſtle ſums up Chriſtianity, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.3. as running upon three things, that like Letters on a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47356:93"/>
are drawn backward, that ye may ſtamp them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in your practice. 1. <hi>That a man have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> 2. That from that he be led <hi>to rejoyce in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And 3. That from that he be led <hi>to worſhip God in the ſpirit.</hi> So anſwerable to theſe three, the Scripture points at three ſorts of means or duties to be gone about in order to the obtaining of pardon; and wee'll find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of all the three in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Something antecedent for preparation to pardon, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>If thou Lord ſhould mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who can ſtand?</hi> 2 Something required to actual cloſing with Chriſt for pardon on the back of that antecedent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, held out, <hi>verſe</hi> 4, <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee.</hi> And, 3. Somewhat required conſequentially as a fruit of pardon, whereby a man comes to know, and to evidence that he is pardoned, and to improve his pardon anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which is ſubjoyned to <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> in the Text, <hi>that thou raayeſt be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, that is, That which is required antecedently to pardon, and as a preparation for it, I ſhall briefly reduce all that I would preſs upon you as to that, to four Heads. And the man that would be in a near ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to get pardon on Goſpel Terms, would look well to all theſe four;</p>
            <p n="1">1. He would be a diligent watcher to prevent his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſin, which he would not miſtake, this would ſeem rather to be required to prevent the need of pardon; but it comes in ſuitably to be adverted unto in order unto the obtaining of pardon, whoever eſſayes the ſeeking of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, will find that their ſtumbling in this ſtep is a great obſtruction to pardon, that they have not been watchful and careful to prevent ſin, a man that hath that to meet him in the Teeth, when he comes to ſeek pardon, that <hi>he hath ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs, That he adds drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs to thirſt, that he hath drunk in iniquity, as the ox doth water;</hi> He will have a harder pull for pardon, than a man
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47356:94"/>
that hath been watchful to prevent ſin, and in falling in ſin, hath been as the chaſt Virgin forced; that will be the firſt queſtion the Conſcience will put to him, how came ye in this poſture? whether voluntarly like a Ship going in her courſe, or like a tempeſt beaten Ship, through ſtreſs of Weather, forced to take the neareſt ſhore? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were ye hurried and driven into ſuch a ſin by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of tentation, or was ye readier to tempt a tentation, than a temptation was to tempt you? O but that will be a ſad challenge in a mans way, in order to the obtaining of pardon; if he hath been a voluntar yielder unto ſin, and a <hi>committer of it with greedineſs:</hi> Nay more, a juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that upon the account of his juſtification, and being pardoned, doth walk more louſly or heedleſly, though he get his ſoul for a prey, he may lay his count to go by the gates of Hell to Heaven, that is, to be keeped at hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in a fighting life with enemies, with his back on the City, and his face to his foes, till he lay down his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons at the gates thereof; therefore in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pardon, I recommend to you careful diligence to prevent falling in ſin, and conſequently thou would look well to the ſin of thy inclination, where thou art weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and guard againſt that, as a wiſe man that is over a Garriſon, will fortifie that part of the Wall that is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, where readily the Enemy will make an aſſault: ſo it would be thy care to guard againſt the ſin thou are moſt inclined to, double thy diligence to mortifie that, to pray againſt it, to watch againſt temptations that may caſt fire in that powder: Thou would alſo look well to the ſin of thy Calling and Station, the ſins of mens Callings being ſuch as they fall more readily into than others; And look well alſo to the Sins of the Time and Place thou lives in, to the Sins of the preſent Generation, wherein many are involved, and ſet a watch againſt theſe; theſe ſins, I ſay, ye would mainly watch againſt, the ſins of your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47356:94"/>
calling, and time or place ye live in, not neglecting to watch againſt all ſins.</p>
            <p>A 2d. Direction I preſs upon you, antecedent to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of pardon, is, That as ye would carefully watch to avoid and prevent ſin, ſo ye would be no leſs careful to examine your ſelves, and call your ſelves to account for ſins, into which ye have fallen; a man cannot repent for ſin, and cannot look for pardon of ſin, without previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examination, and finding out of the guilt for which he ſeeks pardon. It is true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>No man can underſtand his errors,</hi> nor is it poſſible he can overtake all his eſcapes. Even as <hi>David</hi> who was no looſe walker, found <hi>them more than the hairs of his head,</hi> but that muſt not be made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to neglect Examination, look to it, if this be your work, are there none of you who have been upon a back-tract of your way, ſaying, what have I been doing? where have I been? how is God pleaſed with my frame? with my walk and converſation? I fear there are but few that have had, and have this for their exerciſe; and that many follow the counſel of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> that he gave to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> who when he asked him, what he was doing, ſaid, <hi>he was troubled how to make his Accompts to the States, were I ſaid he in thy place, I would rather be troubled how I might not make my Accompt.</hi> I fear many make it their accompt to ſhun and eſchew Self-examination like Bankrupts that ſhun to compare their ſpending with their income and their ſtock, leſt they find themſelves Dyvors, which will have a ſad cloſe. But thou that would not provock God, muſt not neglect Self-examination, if thou do, and let thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on run in confuſion, and go out of thy ſight, remember that word was ſung, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Theſe things thou did, and I kept ſilence, but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes.</hi> He will marſhel and rank your ſins before you, and give you a memory of them, to your terrour and affrightment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:47356:95"/>But a 3d. Direction antecedently required in order to pardon, ſhall be this, That having Examined your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and found out wherein you are faulty, &amp; guilty, ye muſt take a very ſerious and affecting look of ſins deſert, till it leave ſome impreſſions upon the heart; it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter for a man, who needs not a ſecret ſearch to find out his ſin, the skirts of his garment declare it, he may ſhut his Eyes and grope his Abominations. It is eaſie to find out theſe ſins, and to ſeek pardon for them, and there is an end. But O! deceive not thy ſelf, when thou haſt found out thine iniquity, thou muſt be in the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture here, <hi>verſe</hi> 3 <hi>If thou, Lord, mark iniquity who can ſtand?</hi> Thou muſt be affected with it, and ſhall I add, (while I am laying down a Directory for you to follow, in order to the obtaining of pardon, ſo as ye may not cheat your ſelves) to the end ye may walk ſickerly in this matter, I ſhall give you the impreſſion that found out guilt after Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, ſhould leave upon a man in four ſteps; 1. He muſt not only not deny his faults (as too many do, with whom I do not trouble my ſelf, ſome being ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that they care not to deny their vileneſs and other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations with perjuries, to hide them from the world) but he muſt not deny his ſin in the guilt and ill-deſerving of it, he muſt take with it and all it's aggravations, he muſt ſee it in its ſinfulneſs and dreadful deſert. A man that would have pardon from God, muſt not only know his Dittay, but he muſt paſs ſentence on himſelf, and judge himſelf, if he would not be judged for it. Thou haſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, thou haſt found out much ſin, but what thinks thou of it? as it is an offence done by a worm to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God. And haſt thou thought upon the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy ſin, from thy place and ſtation, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Means thou art under, from the many Mercies has been heaped on thee, obliging thee to the contrary? This is it thou ſhould be about, who would be affected with thy ſin, in order to pardon. But 2. This taking with, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47356:95"/>
of ſin, muſt not be an act of the Judgment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it muſt ſink down to the heart, many will dream of ſin, and of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and will talk of ſin, and of the deſert of ſin, but paſs it over with words of that kind; but a ſight of ſin, and a thought of ſin, that is not heart-affecting, is a proclaiming upon the matter thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſin; Thy ſight of ſin, and ſpeaking of it, muſt be like that of the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> here, it makes him in nettle ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and to pour out a pathetick confeſſion of it: It muſt be a ſight and ſenſe of ſin, that bides not in the brain, but goes down to the bottom of thy heart, and affections, and makes thee cry out with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> Thou can talk of ſin, and the demerit of it diſtinctly, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, but as men do of <hi>America,</hi> or ſome new found Land, they know not, but content not thy ſelf with that. The ſight of ſin in order to pardon, requires a heart-pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and affecting. And I ſhall add 3. The ſight of ſin, and it's ſinfulneſs, muſt not be a ſimple affecting only at ſome times. Some cheat themſelves with that alſo, Take them at ſome times, O how are they affected! how mad will the drunkard call himſelf, after that throw his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs he is diſtempered, and hath a ſore head and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtomach? And what a monſter will a profane man ſometimes call himſelf, after a conviction or challenge of Conſcience, but bide till the next bout of a Temptation, and he and his ſin will be as homely as ever, The affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many with ſin is like a ſhower upon the ice in froſt, that wets it above, but brings not a ground thaw: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where there is a right affecting with ſin, it muſt bring the Man with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here, to be reſtleſs under that burden, to ſee that there muſt be no ſtanding ſtill till he be relieved of it. The ſluggard may have his convictions of ſin, and deſires to be rid of it; But the man that ſees ſin in it ſelf, and the conſequences of it, and is rightly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, he will ſee it to be his greateſt miſery, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47356:96"/>
that it muſt be his greateſt haſte to be delivered from it: Many of your convictions are falſe conceptions, ye are in pain with them, but ye do not follow them forth, but ſtiffle them, they never ſet you to your feet, as is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 13.13. <hi>He is an unwiſe ſon, he ſtayeth long in the place of breaking forth of children;</hi> it is a dreadful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſtick in the birth, and to ſtiffle Convictions, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou had never had them (though that caſe be moſt dangerous alſo) than when thou haſt been under them to ſtiffle them, and ſet thy foot upon them, before thou get a true eaſe: And I ſhal add in the 4th. place, In this ſenſe of ſin, that is, when Souls are thus affected with ſin, as I have been ſpeaking, a pardon will be very precious, it will not be lookt upon as the ſcor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er doth, or as the Soldiers who ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Hail, King of the Jews, and then buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted him.</hi> O! a pardon to a moſt ſenſible ſinner, will be moſt glad news, and God on that account will be a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons iniquity;</hi> He will be a bleſſed man whoſe ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>a good Lord that pardons his people,</hi> 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 30.18. And ſo in the Text, he is to the <hi>Pſalmiſt, If thou, Lord, ſhould mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhould ſtand?</hi> But the Back-note is, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee;</hi> for to a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſinner, there being no remedy for ſin, but pardon, and no pardon of ſin, but from a gracious God; what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pardon of ſin be very precious! and God on that account a matchleſs God.</p>
            <p>But a 4th. Direction antecedent to pardon, is, That we ſtudy Repentance for theſe ſins, the pardon whereof we ſtudy and expect, that we may be in capacity for pardon; I ſhall not inſiſt now upon this Doctrine, or Direction, only let me intreat you to make it ſure work in this affair; I have laid your duty ſomewhat home to you, and I fear there is need, ye will take it all and more, and yet in the doing of it, my meaning is not, as if ye could produce theſe things called for, antecedent to pardon, of your ſelf, or that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47356:96"/>
when ye are not come this length, ye ſhould bide away from Chriſt, no, ye muſt come to him for theſe antecedent qualifications, that ye may get pardon. But theſe are the true and faithful ſayings of God, and whoſoever they be that are not in this order ſeeking pardon, and yet think they are pardoned, they had need to look to it, <hi>that they have not a lie in their right hand;</hi> for this is the Scriptures me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, wherein the Lord leads his own to pardon, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth whom he doth pardon. <hi>The Lord bleſs what ye have heard, for Chriſts ſake.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Am now entred upon that which is the Applicatory part of this Doctrine, concerning the pardon of ſins, and upon a way to hold out Directions to you, how without abuſing this great Priviledge, or deceiving your ſelves, ye may come to it in the due order, and look like it; I was ſpeaking before noon of ſome things, required ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent by way of preparation for pardon; I ſpoke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to a Caution and carefulneſs to avoid ſin, that the ſins we come to God for pardon of, may not be theſe we have run after impetuouſly, <hi>as the horſe runneth into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;</hi> but ſuch as we are driven in by the power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Likewiſe that there muſt be an exact and diſtinct account taken daily of our failings, and of theſe evils, the pardon whereof we expect and ſeek. And 3. When upon Examination we have found out our Debt, there muſt be a deep ſenſe of the ſinfulneſs and deſert of theſe provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had here, when he crys out pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically, <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I left at a fourth Direction, and that was, That we
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47356:97"/>
ſhould ſtudy Repentance for theſe ſins, the pardon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we expect and ſeek; and as the former Direction tells, that the ſenſe that theſe in the way of pardon have of ſin, muſt not ly floating in the brain, ſo this will preſs further, That the ſenſe of ſin we have, muſt not be a cruſhing and killing ſenſe, but a ſenſe that reſolves in a kindly Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſin, a ſenſe and hatred of ſin, and a grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, in which poſture they that expect pardon muſt reſolve to come to God. This is ſo clear in the Scriptures, that I adduced in the morning, and it is ſo clear an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the poured out-Spirit, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. Which is a mourning ſpirit in them that partake of it, that I ſhall not inſiſt further to prove it, neither ſhall I digreſs to make a common place of Repentance here, I ſhall only deſire you to take notice of theſe three concerning Repentance, and I have done. 1. That there is a legal Repentance, and an evangelical Repentance; A legal Repentance is that, which flows meerly from the ſenſe of the terrors of the Law, and the curſe and wrath due to men for ſin: And evangelical Repentance is that, which hath ſomething of Faith, and ſomewhat of the Goſpel in its boſom: And I may again deſire you to conſider, that evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is either the reſult of a general apprehenſion, that there is pardoning mercy in God, when a ſinner confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſenſe of guilt, looks in general to this Truth, <hi>That there is forgiveneſs with God,</hi> or more particularly when the ſinner cloſes with that pardoning mercy for his own behove, and makes application of it to himſelf, and ſo is a pardoned man. Now for the Repentance that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to pardon, there muſt be ſomewhat both of legal and evangelical Repentance, ſome Too-look to that great Truth and Encouragement. <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>There is forgivenneſs with thee;</hi> for the legal Repentance it may cruſh, but evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Repentance makes the ſinner to bow; legal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is like a hammer that breaks the Rock; evangelical Repentance is like the fire that melts the mettal, only that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47356:97"/>
Repentance that reſults upon the Application of Pardon to a ſinners ſelf, is not antecedent to, but conſequential of pardon. 2. Ye would conſider the room that Repentance hath in this bargain of the Pardon of ſin, it comes not in certainly by way of merit, for all the Salvation we get firſt and laſt, is through the merit of Chriſt; but Repentance has place in the obtaining of Pardon, partly as it is an inſeparable companion of ſaving Faith, that apprehends and lays hold on Chriſt for Pardon; a man cannot ſay, he has Faith, if it be not a penitent Faith, partly it comes in as a condition required in order to God's Pardoning: for God (as I ſaid before) though he hath promiſed to pardon no man for his Repentance, yet he hath declared, he will pardon none without Repentance; and partly it comes in as a qualification of the perſon pardoned, who is thereby fitted to ly low at Gods Footſtool for pardon, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance makes folk find ſin as bitter, as ever they found it ſweet; Repentance is that which excites them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves, and to juſtifie God; without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it were inconſiſtent with the Juſtice of God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a ſinner, lying impenitent in his filth: nor would it commend the Grace of God, if it were caſt a way to the deſpiſers of Grace, as well as to the penitent, who highly eſteem of Grace. And a 3d. Word I would have you to conſider, is, concerning the degree and meaſure of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; I dare not digreſs on that much. There is a Word that might give folk ground of ſad thoughts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 38. where ye will find a people prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heart, and put to a peremptor, they have compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do? Verſe</hi> 37. and <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer, <hi>Verſe</hi> 38. is <hi>Repent.</hi> They that are pricked in heart, and put to a peremptor, may have their Repentance to begin, not only they that have legal Repentance may have evangelical to begin; but even thoſe who have made ſome progreſs in evangelical Repentance; their hard and impenitent heart may be ſo habituated with obduration,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47356:98"/>
that when they have a gail of the Spirit of Repentance, they may need to employ God to help them to repent to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I ſhall ſay no more on this, but beſeech you to look to your Repentance; it fears me that few be come the length of legal Repentance, or to examine whether they have ſinned or not: But ſuppone that ye had examined and found out ſin &amp; had ſome ſenſe of it. I intreat you make Conſcience of Repentance. Thou that has confidence to believe and ſeek pardon, give this evidence that thou art in earneſt about it, by making Conſcience of Repentance daily. O! how long is it ſince many of you ſat down, and communed with your own heart, and ſmote upon your thigh, ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> How long is it ſince ye was in <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s poſture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Aſhamed, yea confounded, becauſe ye have born the reproach of your youth.</hi> O think on it in earneſt, neglected Repentance daily, will make an ill revel'd Heſp daily to you, if ever ye and your Conſcience meet; (and as I ſaid before) let never folk talk of their Faith, that is not dipped in tenderneſs and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance daily. Only take what hath been ſaid with this Caution, if ye be convinced of your need of repentance, and yet ye want it, ye know where to get it. That <hi>exalted Prince for giving pardon,</hi> is alſo <hi>exalted to give repentance, Acts</hi> 5.31. So much for theſe things required antecedent by way of preparation for pardon.</p>
            <p>In the 2d. place, I propoſed to ſpeak ſomewhat to that, whereby a ſoul ſo qualified &amp; prepared, cloſes with Chriſt for pardon, and that is Faith, whereby a ſinner having his ſin diſcovered, the ſenſe of it wakened up within him, and having made conſcience of Repentance, for it grips unto Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, for the pardon of it, and that is the thing which the 2d. word in the Text holds out; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who can ſtand?</hi> he adds, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>But there is forgiven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with thee;</hi> there is his Faith, cloſing with pardoning mercy, to get a good account of that iniquity and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47356:98"/>
whereof he is convinced: So we find <hi>David,</hi> when making his Teſtament, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> there is his abaſing of himſelf in the ſenſe of ſin, and ſhortcoming in duty; <hi>Yet he hath made with me an everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things and ſure;</hi> he runs to the Remedy, held forth in the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that is it which <hi>Paul</hi> ſubjoins to that which I cited in the morning, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.3. When a man <hi>hath no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> when all beſide Chriſt is fleſh to him; and conſequently that which he dare not have any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in. Then the next ſtep is, not only to cloſe with, but to rejoice in Jeſus Chriſt; That I may make ſomething of this, I ſhall ſpeak a ſhort word to wicked men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a little longer in ſpeaking to convinced ſinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For wicked men, that which I am upon may ſerve to diſcover to them a great miſtake, they are afraid to grow acquaint with themſelves. O! how dow they think of caſting up their accounts? Theſe black Libels, and dreadful Dittays that are lying in proceſs againſt them, that were their ruine, and would undo them; if they ſhould look thereaway, they would never have a day to do well, they would turn deſperat, and I would willingly know what it will avail them, not to look over their Accompts; will they reſolve never to repent? or will they get them ſhifted out of the way? will their forgetting of their faults mend them? will not the iniquity of a man's heels, ſoon or ſyne compaſs him about? <hi>Will not their ſin find them out?</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>Num.</hi> 32.23. But ſhall I add, thou art in a great miſtake, that thinks the ſearching out of thy ſin will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do thee; I confeſs, if thou do it in earneſt, thou muſt not continue in a courſe of ſin as thou haſt done; but it is thy advantage to ſearch out ſin and repent; if thou can ſay, <hi>If thou, Lord, mark iniquity, who can ſtand?</hi> Thou ſhall have reaſon to ſay, <hi>But forgiveneſs is with thee;</hi> Wilt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what rich advantage is in taking with thy guilt, and being humbled for it; that it is a man's ſafety to be thus
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47356:99"/>
loſt, &amp; it is an argument, whereon he may plead for mercy, when he finds himſelf undone without it. It is thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the rich advantage that is on the back of Self-judging, that makes thee voluntarly continue a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>But 2. For theſe who are convinced of ſin, and ſenſible of it, who can ſay. <hi>They have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> and yet dare not ſay, <hi>They rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> I would have ſuch looking upon it as their great miſtake that keeps them from reſting on Chriſt, and rejoycing in him, and it makes all their other exerciſe to be but wind; though ye had ſo much ſorrow for ſin as to ſink you in the pit, if ye add not, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee;</hi> if Chriſt be not the end of all your Exerciſes, they will miſcarry, and leave you ſinking in ſin and miſery. And had I many to ſpeak to that are making conſcience of Repentance of ſin and yet come not up to cloſe with the Remedy of pardoning mercy in Chriſt, I would point out ſeveral things that would be adverted to by ſuch as are in ſuch a frame; and I ſhall pitch on five or ſix of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou that art under convictions of ſin, and does not cloſe with pardoning mercy, thou evidence a miſtake of that mercy, thou conſiders not that thy neceſſity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to ſtand without it, is a claim unto it; thou conſiders not that it is the deſign of the Goſpel to reſcue the loſt, whoſe feet are ſinking; thou conſiders not that then thou begins to be beautiful, when thou becomes loathſom in thine own eyes, and that thou begins to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when thou art put to cry, <hi>Save, Maſter, I periſh;</hi> and ſo in ſtanding a-loof from pardoning mercy, thou miſtakes the deſign of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this ſtanding a loof thou diſcovers thy ignorance of Gods Deſign in giving, thee the ſenſe of thy condition, what a poſture art thou in? Thou art one that ſees thy ſelf abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, monſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſly vile, <hi>the chief of ſinners;</hi> But, may I ſay, who told thee? who ſhewed thee that thou was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47356:99"/>
ſo, and made it out to thee? Has there not been a day when thy condition and frame was as bad, and thou ſaw no ſuch thing, which ſays, that it hath been Chriſt, who by his ſpirit convinceth the world of ſin, that has opened thine eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, diſcovered to thee thy vileneſs through ſin. But thou may think, though he hath done it, yet it is to be the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of a ſad ſentence againſt thee, and to ſend thee to the gate: But if thou abuſe not Mercy, there is another thing in it, if he hath opened thy mouth wide, he will not fill it with an empty ſpoon, but with good things; if he hath made his Law to have a work upon thee, it is not to drive thee from him, but that the Law may be a <hi>ſchool-maſter to bring to Chriſt:</hi> So then it is the ignorance of God's deſign in giving thee the ſenſe of ſin, that makes thee under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions ſtand a loof from Mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this averſion and unwillingneſs to come unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy, I would have you to conſider a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe be believeth not the record that God gave of his Son</hi> (I wiſh that I had many to ſpeak unto, that have to do with theſe things, but I cannot paſs it, being the Applicatory part of the Doctrine. Haſt thou any ſenſe of ſin? art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of wrath becauſe of it? what makes thee afraid? is it not the Authority and Veracity of God, ſpeaking in his Law? when thy Conſcience is wakened, and thou ſees how faulty thou art, and the Law leaves thee under the curſe, it afrights thee, and there is good cauſe; but how comes it, that when thou haſt believed God ſpeaking in his Law unto thee, thou does not believe him ſpeaking in the Promiſe, ſeing it is the ſame God that ſpeaks in both? is not this to make God a liar? and haſt thou not a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt thy ſelf, while the Faith of his threatnings troubles thee? and yet the Faith of his Promiſes doth not encourage and comfort thee.</p>
            <p>But 4. In this unwillingneſs to cloſe with pardoning
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47356:100"/>
Mercy, read corrupt and ill principles, man by nature is ignorant of a Goſpel-righteouſneſs, he knows nothing of Pardoning Mercy through a Mediator; but if the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works be once broken, it is everlaſtingly broken; and hence the ſenſible ſinner being ignorant of the New Covenant of Grace he chooſes rather to ly mourning under the ruines of that firſt Covenant, than to look up to a better; and this ignorance of Gods righteouſneſs, is a thing which the Saints ought rather to mourn for than to foſter.</p>
            <p>But 5. In this ſtanding a-back of ſenſible ſinners from pardoning Mercy, and in not cloſing therewith; ye would look upon pride of Heart, as having a main hand in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. The reaſon why the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>not ſubmit unto the righteouſneſs of God, they went about to eſtabliſh their own.</hi> A doubting Soul in its exerciſe, may ſeem to be very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and crucified, it may be, but it is not humbled; but while it ſtands a-loof from pardoning Mercy, proclaims its Pride, for it proclaims it would have a price to bring in its hand to God, and God is angry at that pride, he will have thee coming to him as a Dyvour, when thou haſt tryed all thou can do to the yondmoſt.</p>
            <p>And 6. and laſtly in this averſion, read another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, folk think it preſumption when they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their vileneſs, to cloſe with pardoning Mercy; but it is ſo far from being preſumption, that it is the greateſt evidence of humility to take mercy freely, when thou comes to the Mercat of Free-grace with no price in thy hand, and not only ſo, but it is a high honouring of God. The man that being ſenſible of his ſinfulneſs, cloſeth with pardoning Mercy, doth with <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Give glory to God,</hi> and by his <hi>receiving his teſtimony, put to his ſeal that God is true; Joh.</hi> 3.33. and therefore any that are ſenſible of ſin, and have any thing of the conviction of the dreadful deſert of ſin, and are in any meaſure in the exerciſe of repentance for ſin, they would take notice of theſe things that I have named, as ſtumbling blocks in their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47356:100"/>
way of cloſing with pardoning Mercy, and labour to take them out of it, that they may come up to cloſe with it, and ſay, <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But now becauſe folk may readily ſay, all that I ſpoke to in the Morning for preparation to cloſing with pardoning Mercy, is good, and when they hear it holden out as the will of God, that a ſenſible ſinner ſhould lay hold on Chriſt for pardon; who are they that will not ſay, they have ſenſe of ſin, and may take a pardon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the ſtumbling of ſuch, <hi>I</hi> ſhall in the 3d. place, as I propoſed in the entry, ſpeak to ſome things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired conſequentially as a fruit of pardon, whereby a man comes to know, and evidence that he is pardoned, and to improve his pardon, anſwerable to that ſubjoyned <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi> in the Text; and here, in ſpeaking to the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of pardon <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> as we uſe to ſpeak, or which are conſequential to pardon, I might touch upon many things; but in general, as thoſe that would ſee the riſing of the Sun in the Eaſt, they would look to the Weſt, where they will ſee by the ſhade of his Beams when he riſes; ſo theſe that would make their pardon ſure, would mind well the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of pardon, as the ſureſt evidences of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and that they are not deluded in that matter.</p>
            <p>And the 1st. that I would recommend to you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is, <hi>Love to the Pardoner;</hi> There is none hath gotten pardon, but it will kyth in this, and for proof of it, take notice of that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. Where Chriſt ſpeaking of the <hi>woman that waſht his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head,</hi> he ſays, <hi>her ſins which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much;</hi> The meaning is not, that her great love to Chriſt did merit a pardon, for if ye read the Parable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from <hi>verſe</hi> 40. It will clear, that that is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt ſays to <hi>Simon, Which of the Debitors will love the Creditor moſt? Simon</hi> anſwers, <hi>I ſuppoſe be to whom he forgave moſt.</hi> There Love is the reſult of pardon, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of pardon, not the cauſe; and it is in that caſe, that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47356:101"/>
Chriſt applys it to the woman, ſuch love to me is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence <hi>that much is forgiven her;</hi> I would have imbittered folk, and ſuch as are reflecters upon, and carps at Providential Diſpenſations, noticing this, That it is no good evidence of pardon; and thou that has love to him, whatever be his Diſpenſations towards thee, it ſpeaks good news of pardon, though thou cannot diſcern it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I recommend much Heart-melting and Evangelical Repentance, whereof I ſpoke before, as it is required an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to pardon; now I preſs that which is conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to pardon, when a ſinner hath cloſed with pardoning Mercy, and by a reflex act, looks back upon what hath been forgiven him: O what melting of heart hath it, as in that woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47 <hi>Much is forgiven her, therefore ſhe loveth much,</hi> and that melted her heart, and made her weep much; ſhe is a tender melting woman; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if thou be a Child, the too look to pardon, and much more the application of pardon will melt the heart, and work more than many Rods.</p>
            <p>And 3. I recommend to you as a Conſequence of Pardon, a deep ſenſe of the hainouſneſs of the ſin pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and much compaſſion toward them who are yet lying in the ſame pollution and guilt; a pardoned ſinner look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his ſin through the Glaſs of pardoning Mercy, it grows much more hainous than it was; and a pardoned man cannot but with compaſſion look on others lying in the puddle of Nature, <hi>Titus</hi> 3, 2, 7 <hi>Speak evil of no man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but be gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men, for we our ſelves were ſometime fooliſh, diſobedient,</hi> &amp;c. till the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs of God was manifeſted; O what compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will the pardoned man have towards others wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that pollution, from which he is delivered.</p>
            <p>There are other two Evidences conſequential to pardon, one is, <hi>Our forgiving of others, Mat.</hi> 6.12. which is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious antecedent cauſe of pardon; for it is the ſenſe of Chriſt, pardoning Mercy to us, that ſhould and doth looſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47356:101"/>
our hearts to pardon others; we are bidden ſay, <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors:</hi> Another Evidence in the Text, is <hi>holy filial fear;</hi> but becauſe the one of theſe is a Point in the Text, and the other concerns the pardoning of one another, as an evidence we are pardoned, which will require more time to deduce, than now we have. I ſhall fiſt here for this time. <hi>The Lord bleſs his Word to you.</hi>

            <p>YE may remember that I have inſiſted long upon this excellent Priviledge, <hi>The remiſſion, or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins;</hi> I have ſpoken to the Object of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or what it is that is pardoned, <hi>Iniquity:</hi> I have alſo ſpoken to the Author of pardon, <hi>GOD:</hi> To the Nature of Pardon, and when it is that Pardon is pronounced; and I entered the laſt day upon the Applicatory part of this Doctrine, to lead you in a right way of cloſing with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy, following the ſcope of the Context, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak of ſomewhat required antecedently to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; to ſomewhat required in cloſing with pardon, and of ſomething conſequential to pardon, whereby we Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we are pardoned, and do improve our pardon: I ſpoke to the firſt of theſe, and ſhew, that in order to the obtaining of pardon, men ſhould be careful not to run headlong and voluntarly on in ſin, for that will make the coming at pardon more difficult, that they ſhould be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in ſelf examination, to find out ſin; That they ſhould be ſerious in laying to heart the deſert of ſin, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. And ſerious in Repentance for ſin: I told you alſo that theſe things being premitted, it was the duty of the penitent ſinner, by Faith to cloſe with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy, which I cloſed with a check, both to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47356:102"/>
wicked, who becauſe they ſee not the advantage, which is on the back of Conviction of Sin, never look their ſin in the face; and with a check to the godly, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being humbled in the ſenſe of ſin, ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back from cloſing with pardoning Mercy. And I came in the third place to ſpeak to what was conſequentially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to pardon, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here having ſaid, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee;</hi> he adds, as a conſequence of it, <hi>that thou mayeſt be feared:</hi> And upon this Head, I named two or three things, as native Conſequences of pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as that there muſt be love to the Pardoner, as that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. did evince, <hi>much was forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much:</hi> That there muſt be a Heart-melting, when we reflect upon the <hi>pardoning of iniquity;</hi> and a Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> looking on them that are ſtill lying in that pit, that through mercy we have eſcaped. I told you there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two conſequential evidences of pardon, that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to inſiſt a little more on: As, 1ſt. The forgiving of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have injured us: And 2ly. The fearing and ſerving of God; the one of theſe I find it neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, becauſe it is put in by Chriſt, in that pattern of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. And the other becauſe it is recorded in the Text, to be a conſequent of pardon.</p>
            <p>For the 1ſt. of theſe, concerning the forgiving of others, I ſhall briefly ſpeak to theſe three anent it, as it is ſpoken of in that Pattern of Prayer: 1. That the people of God are getting wrongs in the World. 2. That it is the will of God that we ſhould forgive thoſe that wrong us. 3. That folks forgiving of others that wrong them, is an evidence of their being pardoned themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The people of God, theſe that are allowed in the Pattern of Prayer to call God Father, they are getting wrongs in the World, they are getting debts in the World, they have their debters in it; thereby is not meant ſo much, men that are under civil obligations to pay the debt they owe to them, (though that may have its own place, as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47356:102"/>
we may hear,) as chiefly and mainly, wrongs, injuries, unrighteous dealing, violating the Law of Love in their carriage and deportment. This is the condition, the woful condition, that all the Children of men are in ſince the fall, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. <hi>They are fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another;</hi> and <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13, 14. Tells, <hi>that men are like the fiſhes of the ſea, and the creeping things that have no ruler over them,</hi> where the greater are ready to devour the ſmaller, and the children of God are large ſharers in this matter. And <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. That before Converſion, <hi>he was a blaſphemer, injurious, and a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. Chriſt ſuppoſes the godly will have enemies, <hi>curſers of them, haters of them, ſuch as will deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe them, and perſecute them;</hi> and experience in all ages makes it out, how much work fearers of God have for this ſweet diſpoſition called for in them, to be forgivers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall ſay from this, ſhall be in the firſt place to invite you to conſider the ſtate of all mankind ſince the fall, as the Proverb is, <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> one man is a wolf to another, that men are now more ready to wrong and injure one another, than the brute beaſts are in their own kind; this is a ſad document how far man is fallen from God by ſin. 2. From this I would have the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take warning what they are to expect in the world; they will have wrongs to bear, injuries to ſuffer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, debts to forgive; Cement as we will theſe two ſeeds, the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent will never be one, one Family and Ark, one Womb will never make them one: But as it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>As he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo is it now.</hi> Therefore ye are not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when ye meet with trouble and perſecution in the world, but rather wonder at the moderation ye meet with.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47356:103"/>
3. Let it be a warning to them that wrong others, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they conſtitute themſelves debitors, injurers, breakers of the Law of love, if not of juſtice and righteouſneſs alſo. They run themſelves under debt, which they muſt repent of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.4. and make reſtitution of, with <hi>Zacheus, Luk.</hi> 19.8. They muſt not ſtand upon their credit ſo to do, neither muſt they be as many, who if they do an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, reſolve to cruſh them utterly to whom they have done it, that they may not be able to repay it, and beſide that, they may remember, that God is the principal Creditor, who will crave and exact that debt, if it be not repented and pardoned.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing propoſed to be ſpoken to, is, That it is the will of God, that theſe debts men contract, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the people of God, his people ſhould forgive them; Chriſt will have them to ſay, <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</hi> Mat. 6.12. It is commanded, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Col. 3.13. <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye.</hi> And our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. when <hi>v.</hi> 44. he hath bidden his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>love their enemies, bleſs them that curſe them, do good to them that hate them, and pray for them that despitefully uſe and perſecute them;</hi> he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 45. That thereby they ſhould evidence their good condition, they ſhould evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence themſelves to be <hi>children of their Father which is in Heaven, that maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſends his rain on the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I would ſay anent this forgiving of injuries, ſhall be briefly in anſwer to a few Queſtions: As</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be inquired what it is that men ſhould forgive? 1. I anſwer, for Civil Debts, (what-ever the Law of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity requires in ſome caſes, as to that, yet) it is, as we
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47356:103"/>
hinted before) mainly wrongs, injuries, defraudations, perſecutions, oppreſſions and the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be aſked, How can we forgive theſe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins againſt God? Ye may remember, when I ſpake before of the Author of pardon, I ſpoke of that, a man that is wronged can only forgive what concerns his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but the perſon that wrongs God, is ſtill lyable to God for his intereſt; thy forgivenneſs of the wrong done to thee, is not a total abſolution, but for what concerns God, the injurious perſon is ſtill comptable to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be inquired on what terms ſhould men forgive? I Anſwer, as to the matter of envy, malice, deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, rancour, hatred, a man is bound to forgive, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the temper of him be that does the wrong, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.24. <hi>When ye ſtand praying, forgive</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>if ye have ought against any, that your Father which is in Heaven may forgive you;</hi> intimating, that if a man hath done thee an ill turn, thou muſt not becauſe of that do thy ſelf a worſe, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a grudge, thou muſt not let rancour obſtruct thy acceſs to God in Prayer; yea, whether he repent or not, thou art bound to heap coals of fire upon his head to melt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. And therefore <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5. When our neighbours Ox or Aſs is going aſtray, or the Aſs of him that hates us is lying under a burden, we muſt bring the one to him, and help up the other. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. <hi>If thine enemy hunger,</hi> thou muſt <hi>feed him; if he thirſt,</hi> thou muſt <hi>give him drink,</hi> and ſo witneſs that thou art willing to pardon him; all this thou art bound to, what-ever be the carriage of him that injures thee; but for familiar or intimat converſe, there is repentance in the injurer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.4. <hi>If thy brother treſpaſs against thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again unto thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If it be inquired, How ſhall this forgivenneſs be gone about and expreſſed? I anſwer, that here we muſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47356:104"/>
beware of Satans wiles; there are many that will forgive, but not forget; ye will find many in forgiving, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is like <hi>Abſaloms</hi> to his Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.22. <hi>He ſpake not to his brother good nor bad,</hi> but when he got an opportunity he killed him: This is not Chriſtian-forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs; it's the practice of many to cover their hatred with lying lips, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.18. There are many that ſpeak fair unto their neighbour, when <hi>ſeven abominations are in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</hi> to <hi>Amaſa, who came,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Art thou in health, my brother? And took him by the beard to kiſs him; but ſmote him under the fifth rib, and ſlew him,</hi> 2 Sam. 20.9, 10. That's not Scripture-forgivenneſs, the Scripture preſſeth forgiven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.35. <hi>So ſhall my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive every one his brother.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. We ſhould <hi>love our enemies, bleſs them that curſe us, do good to them that hate us, pray for them that despitefully uſe and perſecute us,</hi> that's forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs acceptable to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If ye inquire, how often and frequently are folk bound to forgive the debts of injuries done to them? I can give you no more fuccinct anſwer than Chriſt gives, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.21.— <hi>Peter ſaith, How often ſhall my brother ſin against me, and I forgive him till ſeven times?</hi> Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>I ſay not to thee, till ſeven times, but till ſeventy times ſeven;</hi> that is, though injuries were never ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, that (as ye uſe to ſpeak) it would provoke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience it ſelf, yet it is the will of our bleſſed Lord, that there be forgivenneſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If ye aſk, Shall men then ſo forgive, that there ſhall no purſuit be of injuries done to them? Shall they ly down and take as many wrongs as folks like to do unto them, and make no more of it, but forgive them? I anſwer, no doubt reparations are allowed and required, and the Law and Civil Magiſtrat may be made uſe of for that end, or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47356:104"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n caſe the matter be betwixt Magiſtrats by a Civil War: But in ſo far as concerns us in our privat ſtations, I ſhall give you a few words for clearing the caſe: And firſt, when a man forgives an injury, he is not always obliged to paſs the damnage; he may forgive the wicked diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any oppreſſor or cheater, when he is not bound to forgo the loſs he hath ſuſtained; partly becauſe by the eighth Command he is bound to look to his own ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo to recover his own for that end; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the damnage belongs to the Civil Magiſtrat, to ſee to, and right or puniſh, and therefore privat perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgive theſe. Yet 2. in ſome caſes, we are not only bound to forgive the injury, but the damnage alſo: That is, when a man may ſubſiſt without that which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer hath taken from him, and the injurious perſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without his own ruine make ſatisfaction or reſtitution, in that caſe the Law of Charity, though not ſtrict Juſtice, will plead for forgivenneſs in the matter of damnage. And 3. Even when a man is to forgive the injury, but not the damnage, he is not to make reparation at his own hand, he is not to walk out of Gods way to get the damnage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; when he hath got a wrong, he is not to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a wrong, and God another wrong to right it. And 4. In ſeeking reparation in the matter of damnage, we would take heed that we be not ſcandalous. The Apoſtle taxeth a fault in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. — That they vexed their brethren, in going to Law with them, eſpecially under Infidels and Heathen Judges. There are many caſes which may prove ſcandalous among Profeſſors, and this is one, when in petty injuries which they ſhould bury, they vex one another in Law. And 5. When a man goes to Law, to ſeek reparation of a damnage, it ſhould not only be the laſt refuge, as a Phyſitian, when he cuts off a leg or an arm, for the preſervation of the life of the Patient, but his ſeeking reparation muſt be ſo managed,

It were a ſpecial mean to bring you this pardoning-humour, to be daily ſenſible of the wrongs that ye have done, and are doing to God, and who wots but a wrong done by thee to God is laid in thy diſh by a third hand, to make thee ſenſible of it? The man that is daily ſenſible of the wrongs he doth to God, is the only man to be a good

neighbour; when he comes out loadned with the ſenſe of his own provocations, he will be ready to forgive others: He that finds he hath ten thouſand talents to be forgiven, will eaſily be brought to forgive an hundred pence. It's our diſtance with God, and the want of the ſenſe of the wrongs done to him, that makes us keep up a revengful humour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They that would have this pardoning-diſpoſition, would be ſenſible of how much need they have to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given themſelves, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>Take not heed unto all words that are ſpoken, leſt thou hear thy ſervant curſe thee;</hi> do not ſaſh thy ſelf with noticing every injury, were it from as mean a perſon as thy ſervant, <hi>for oft-times alſo thine own heart knoweth, that thou thy ſelf haſt curſed others.</hi> There is no living in the world, if (as we uſe to ſpeak) we do not live and let live, if we forgive not as we would be forgiven; If thou ſeeſt a more in thy brothers eye, pull the beam out of thine own, and then thou wilt ſee more clearly to pull the more out of thy brother's eye: This will make thee of a meek and condeſcending frame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I recommend to thee that would forgive, to labour to get a ſight of the hand of God in the wrong done to thee: When thou gets a wrong, it may be of a perſon far below thee, and one that thou can eaſily reach, O! How doth poor duſt ſwell with thoughts of revenge? But were the hand of God ſeen in that wrong, it would tame thee; when <hi>David</hi> is fleeing from his ſon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Shimei</hi> comes out and curſes him, <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Unqueſtionably it is not unconcerned in the affronts and injuries done to us by men, and whatever thou haſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47356:109"/>
to ſay to the perſon that hath injured thee; yet if thou look up to the hand of God in it, thou wilt be ſilent, and calm.</p>
            <p>And 4. Remember, when thou does not pardon, but offers to revenge at thine own hand, thou uſurps Gods place, Rom. 12.19. <hi>Dearly beloved, revenge not your ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord:</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, when thou offers to revenge, thou takes his place, and provocks him to leave thee, and let thee ſtand to thy ſelf, and not concern himſelf in any wrong done to thee.</p>
            <p>But the third thing I propoſed to ſpeak a word to, is, That this forgivenneſs of others is abſolutely neceſſary to them that would evidence, that they are pardoned of God themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. We are bidden pray, <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive others;</hi> I ſhall briefly explain this, and cloſe. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. As I have often hinted before, our forgiving others doth nor merit pardon; for forgiving of others is not an antecedent to pardon, but a conſequence of it; it's the evidence of a pardoned man, and conſequently cannot be antecedent to pardon, far leſs a meritorious cauſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p n="2">2. While Chriſt bids us pray, <hi>Forgive us, as we forgive,</hi> there is no proportion to be underſtood; there is a vaſt difference betwixt Gods forgiving and our forgiving; his forgivenneſs extends to <hi>ten thouſand talents,</hi> ours only to <hi>an hundred pence, Mat.</hi> 18.24, 28. His forgiving requires a ſatisfaction to juſtice, before he give out the ſentence of pardon, not ſo ours; his forgivenneſs brings no profit to him as ours doth to us, we having thereby acceſs to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy; only in this the parallel holds, that we forgive frankly and freely, as God forgives us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the connexion a little more nearly, partly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47356:109"/>
it is an encouragement to the ſenſible ſinner, to believe he is pardoned, when he finds a diſpoſition in himſelf to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give others; a poor ſenſible ſinner lying at Gods foot-ſtool, ſuing for pardon, though he be pardoned, yet he hath a hink whether he be ſo or not; but this encourages him to believe it, that he finds in himſelf a looſing of heart to forgive another, that hath wronged him often; he may reaſon, have I gotten many wrongs, and yet I can find in my heart to forgive, and put them in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome that have wronged me, upon their repentance? and ſhall I doubt but God, who is a God infinite in mercy, hath pardoned me? So that thy warmneſs and looſing of heart to forgive others, looſes and opens a door to thee, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the infinite God in mercy hath pardoned thee; and partly, ye would remember, that it is a condition of pardon, not antecedent, but ſubſequent, whereby a man may reflect and gather whether he be pardoned or not, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. he contents not himſelf to ſay, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give if we would be forgiven,</hi> but he adds, <hi>if ye forgive men their trespaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your trespaſſes.</hi> Ye can have no evidence that ye your ſelves are pardoned, except ye have a tender diſpoſition and frame of heart to forgive others; and therefore that ſervant, who <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.27. had ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents forgiven him, and yet when he got his fellow-ſervant, would not forgive him an hundred pence, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that though he ſeemed to be forgiven, he was not forgiven, but behoved to go to priſon.</p>
            <p>Now I have been detained in providence upon this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for this time, a Doctrine that is not unſeaſonable to you, if ye be in earneſt in ſeeking the pardon of your ſin; it ſerves to point out to you the terms on which it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, and by which ye evidence that ye are pardoned, that ye may not in this matter cheat your ſelves, in taking
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47356:110"/>
a lie in your right hand in ſtead of pardon; and it is not unſeaſonable, were it but to give a check to the malicious diſpoſition that haunts too too many in this generation. What ſhall I ſay of it?

            <p>IN the morning I was detained upon that evidence of a pardoned man, which is of very common uſe in our walk, that we have a tender-hearted diſpoſition, and be in a readineſs to forgive others. Now there remains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave this point, another evidence or conſequence of pardon, when it is rightly cloſed with, held out in that, which ye may remember I made a third branch of this Text, being an amplification of pardoning mercy, taken from Gods deſign in letting it out, even that he may be feared; I ſhall not here ſtand on a general, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is to look to Gods deſign, and what he drives at by every thing he doth unto us, and about us, as the Pſalmiſt takes notice of Gods end in pardoning. Though it were needful that we ſhould look to it, that we abuſe no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God, to ſerve our own ends, neglecting his ends. The reaſon why we ſpeed not in many ſuits, is, <hi>we ask and receive not, becauſe we ask amiſs, that we may conſume it upon our lusts,</hi> Jam. 4.3. But paſſing that, I come to the word in the Text.</p>
            <p>The word here, <hi>fear of God,</hi> it is one of theſe internal graces that naturally reſults upon the acknowledgment of a Deity, and conſequently belongs to the firſt Command, where knowledge and acknowledgment of God, faith and hope in God, love to him, and fear of him, and patience under his diſpenſations, are all commanded under that of having no other gods; but frequently the fear of God is taken more largely, for all the ſervice, and fear, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47356:111"/>
of God, and that becauſe fear and reverence is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ingredient called for in every part of ſervice and worſhip we perform, here we need not reſtrict the ſenſe of the Word, and ſo the meaning is, pardoning Mercy is in God, and let forth by God to the penitent, that the pardoned ſinner may ſtand in awe to offend God, and may be invited to worſhip and ſerve God, who invites him to it by a free pardon of iniquity, under which he could not ſtand, if God ſhould mark it in ſtrict Juſtice. And hence in that ſum of Chriſtianity, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.3. If a man from having no confidence in the fleſh come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Jeſus Chriſt, the reſult of that is to worſhip God in the Spirit; hence <hi>Job</hi> 37.23, 24. When God is taken up as one excellent in Power, Judgment, and plenty of Juſtice, that will not afflict, it hath this conſequence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting upon it, men do therefore fear him; and 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.38. — when his people pray to him, he by his hearing of Prayer, forgiving of ſin, doing and giving to every man according to his ways, doth hereby invite them to fear him, all the days that they live in the Land which he gave to their Fathers, and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. It is ſaid of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſrael, That <hi>they ſhall fear the Lord, and his goodneſs, in the latter dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may ſpeak ſomewhat of this for your edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I ſhall take a word or two from this purpoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly conſidered, and then conſider it with an eye to the ſcope.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then conſidering the words abſtractly, we may mark, that fear and reverence is due to God, that God is a ſuitable Object of humble and reverential fear in the Creature; the fear of God is a thing frequently ſpoken of, and preſt in Scripture, as moſt due to him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name, Pſal.</hi> 76.7, 11. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared;</hi> bring preſents to him that ought to be feared, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of hoſts himſelf, let him be your fear and your dread:</hi> He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifying Fear) the Scripture ſometimes Names God by this, <hi>That he is the fear of his people. Gen.</hi> 31.53. when <hi>Laban ſware by the God of Abraham, and the God of Nabor, Jacob ſware by the fear of his father Iſaac,</hi> that is, by the God that was the Object of <hi>Iſaac's</hi> fear: and that word is very emphatick, which ye have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. in your Tranſlation it is, <hi>bring preſents to him that ought to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> but in the Original (and as it is rendred in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of your Bibles) it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>bring preſents to the fear,</hi> that is, to God, the Object of the reverential fear of his people; It may be ſaid that the Object of fear being things evil, God who is the Chief Good, ſeems not to be the proper Object of fear; but that is eaſily cleared, affection to God, as to the chief Good, cannot be without holy ſolicitude, and reverential fear, leſt either our ſin deprive us of him, and of his favour, or he be provocked to ſend evil on us, upon the account of our provocations.</p>
            <p>Now for the kinds of this fear of God, I ſhall not inſiſt upon them. There is a fear of God as a plague and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that's the fear of Devils, <hi>James</hi> 2.9. <hi>Thou believeſt there is one God, thou doſt well, the devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> There is a ſervile and ſlaviſh fear, which however it may be in a Child of God, eſpecially at his firſt Converſion, while under the ſpirit of bondage, yet it is much of the nature of that fear, that is of God as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin; that tormenting fear the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. <hi>That perfect love caſts out;</hi> that fear that is not afraid of offending God, but of puniſhments only, is that which is in Devils; and that fear that apprehends puniſhments, not as they are ſeparat from God the chief Good, but as painful and grievous to a mans ſelf, is ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and ſervile; but right fear is, when apprehenſions of the Majeſty, Greatneſs, and Goodneſs of God, fills the heart with holy awe and reverence towards him, and the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47356:112"/>
Faith of his Greatneſs, ſeaſoned with the Faith of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendency, makes the ſoul afraid to offend him, or loſe his favour on any terms.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall ſay from this, ſhall be to exhort and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to get ſome ſtamp of this reverential fear on your heart that ye be not of them, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1.

be glorified;</hi> I will either be honoured by them, or I will be honoured upon them that draw near me, and take my Name in vain. Well then, have ye any thing of this Fear of God? will ye kythe it by your ſerving him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>A ſon honoureth his father, and a ſervant his maſter, if he be a Father, where is his honour, and if a Maſter, where is his fear?</hi> ſtand ye in awe of God that do misken him all your time? do ye fear him, that never take a ſpare hour to pay homage to him? that will not bow a knee to him: But I ſhall add, the ſervice that ye pay to God, <hi>I</hi> pray you look how it is ballaſt with fear, that it turn not in preſumption; and if ye have need of an intimation of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to correct your fear, that it degener not in deſpondency: Ye come to God's Houſe to Worſhip him, but how few of you when ye come here, have ſaid, <hi>How dreadful is this place;</hi> would ye have your Character? take it from <hi>Jude verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Theſe are ſpots in your feaſts of charity, when they feaſt with you, feeding themſelves without fear;</hi> ye come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, ye join in the publick Exerciſes of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but without any impreſſion of the fear of God, more than if all we did while we are together, had no relation to him; O be aſhamed that the fear and awe of God doth ſo little ballaſt and ſeaſon your ſervice and worſhip.</p>
            <p>But in the 2. place, we come to take a look of this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with an eye to the Scope, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi> then, the fear of God, more tender walking, being more frequent and ſerious in duty to God, more reverence of his ſervice, it is the kindly product of a heart that hath on right terms cloſed with Chriſt in pardoning mercy, a fear to offend God, a reverential fear in his Worſhip and ſervice.

            <p n="2">2. If pardoning Mercy be let out, that God may be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it puts me in capacity to anſwer the Cavillations of the profane, they live in the contempt of holineſs, they have a prejudice at it, they ſee no form nor beauty in it, wherefore they ſhould deſire it; What ſhall they get if they turn fearers of God? They ſee no advantage by it, but loſs: But ſhall I ſay to thee, if thou looked rightly on it, thou would be aſhamed to owne any ſuch Cavillation, Piety has no enemy but an ignorant, there is none that ever knew Piety that would give it the Character thou gives it; if pardoning Mercy work up a love to holineſs in men, and make them to fear him; thou that has a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice at holineſs, evidences that thou art not a partaker of it, and why would thou tell all the World, that thou knows not what this pardoning Mercy means; thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of holineſs proclaims, that all thy iniquities are bound upon thy back: If ever thou had layen at Gods Foot ſtool, and been lift up with pardoning Mercy, ſaying to thee, <hi>Son or daughter be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> it would put an edge upon thee, to purſue after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and therefore let me intreat you who are profane, and entertain a prejudice at holineſs, not to publiſh your own ſhame, and by your contempt of the fear of God, and his ſervice, to declare ye are yet without the pardoning Mercy of God.</p>
            <p>But from this ye ſhall take a 3. word, If cloſing with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy ſets hearts on work to fear God, and to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in the ſtudy of holineſs, then ye may ſee how many of the Children of God do cut the throat of all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after holineſs, and to walk tenderly through their

not cloſing with pardoning Mercy: I ſuppoſe ſome have the Conſcience, a ſad Monitor unto them, a ſad Wan-reſt within doors, for want of tenderneſs, and ſome would fain be at ſerving and worſhipping of God, and yet they cannot win at it, but look if thou leaves not thy encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement behind thy hand, in not cloſing with pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy, and by ſo doing, not only cuts thy ſelf ſhort of the Joy of the Lord, which is thy ſtrength, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocks God to blaſt thy ſtudy of holineſs, that thou would put in his room, or in the room of his pardoning Mercy; But thou that would be keeped freſh and green in thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of holineſs, here is thy method that thou muſt follow; firſt, wrap thy ſelf in the boſom of pardoning Mercy and then try thy work and thou ſhalt find it more delightſome and go better with thee, than when thou leaves this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement behind thee, lay thy ſelf in his boſom for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and O! but that will make thee fear him much, and love him much; that woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>bad much forgiven her, loved much,</hi> and had abundance of <hi>tears to waſh Chriſt's feet;</hi> her cloſing with pardon did ſo melt her heart, and ſo would it thine; cloſing with pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would heal palſie hands and feet, and make thee work, walk and run, it would kindle that <hi>love that is ſtrong as death,</hi> and that <hi>jealouſie that is cruel as the grave,</hi> the coals whereof are coals of fire, that have a vehement flame, and bring it to that, that many waters cannot quench, or the floods drown, or contemn all that would compet with it.

            <p>YE heard when I entred upon this Pſalm, that the firſt ſix Verſes contain the wreſtling and the exerciſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was under, as the laſt two Verſes contain his victory and iſſue, and his improvement of it.</p>
            <p>For his wreſtling and exerciſe, it conſiſts (as ye heard) of three branches, ye have him wreſtling with the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and plunging perplexities in his caſe; theſe he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes under the Metaphor <hi>of depths,</hi> and his wreſtling with them is, by fervent wreſtling and crying to God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>verſes</hi> 1, 2. 2. Ye have him wreſtling with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and ſenſe of guilt, that obſtructed his audience, put back his Prayers, and offered to cruſh his hopes, and with that he wreſtles in the 3, and 4. Verſes, by taking with the dreadful deſert of ſin, by laying hold on God's pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy, and carrying alongſt with him God's end in letting out pardoning Mercy to ſinners, even <hi>that he may be feared:</hi> and of this ſubject I have been ſpeaking at great length, and I muſt exhort and intreat, that though a cloſe be put to Preaching on it, that yet ye may not give over the minding of that Doctrine, it is that which will be your great Paſport; pardoning Mercy if ye obtain it, when ye
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47356:119"/>
come to grapple with the King of Terrors, and go through the dark valley of the ſhadow of death.</p>
            <p>Now in the two Verſes read, ye have the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the third place wreſtling with delays of anſwers to his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or the delays of the out-gate prayed for, and theſe he wreſtles with by confident, patient, affection at waiting on God, <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope &amp;c.</hi> And this purpoſe alſo we have cauſe to look unto, becauſe it gives an account of a Chriſtians conſtant exerciſe in time; he that would be a Chriſtian indeed, it is not enough that he pray in difficulties, that he take with the deſert of ſin, and look to pardoning Mercy, when Conſcience challenges him, but when he hath done all that, he muſt perſevere in ſo doing, and wreſtle with the delays of anſwers to his Prayer, he muſt give a proof of the patience, as well as of the Faith of the Saints, he muſt be a follower of theſe who through Faith and Patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>There is a general Remark which will make way to the purpoſe contained in the words, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall inſiſt on a little, that is That perſeverance and conſtant waiting on God in his way, is the great task of Saints, and the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of their ſincerity in all other exerciſes and duties. This tryes how well breathed the Saints are, and what is their integrity in other exerciſes that they are at ſometimes, even that they be conſtant, bide by it, wait on God, and perſevere in waiting on him in his way, notwithſtanding they meet with delays.</p>
            <p>And that I may unfold this General to you, ye ſhall with me take a threefold look of this perſeverance. 1. Look upon it in general, as it is oppoſed to Apoſtacy, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding &amp; giving up with the ways of Religion. 2. (Which will deduce this General more fully and particularly) ye ſhall take a look of this perſeverance, as it imports a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tenor and courſe in waiting on God, and ſeeking of God, in oppoſition to folks phraſes, fairds and hot fits
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47356:119"/>
at ſome times, wherein they are but fleeting. And 3. (Which will lead me to the particular in the Text) look on it as it is oppoſed to wearying, ſitting up, or falling by from employing God, and waiting on him, if they be delayed, eſpecially in ſad diſpenſations, and exigences they meet with.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, Perſeverance in general, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to apoſtaſie, back-ſliding, and giving up with the ways of God, and godlineſs; I ſhall not dwell much on that Doctrine. The neceſſity of it appears in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made unto it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13. <hi>It is he that endures unto the end ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. Chapters, it is always to the overcomer that the Promiſe is made, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Word, there being in the preſent time, To him that overcometh, or is overcoming, it is to aſſure them, that are in earneſt in the battel and in purſuit of the Victory, that they may grip the promiſe for their encouragement; yet it is to the overcomer, to him that endures to the end, to the compleat Victory that the Promiſe relates. Neither 2. ſhall I ſpeak to the poſſibility and impoſſibility of this apoſtaſie, and back-ſliding. I confeſs if I ſpeak of the Saints that are truely regenerat, it is impoſſible that they can totally and finally fall away. There is a ſeed that ſtill remains in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Not that that ſeed being but a Creature can preſerve it ſelf of it ſelf, but its remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtability depends on the eternal decree of God concerning the Elect (<hi>For whom he forknows and predeſtinats to be conform to the image of his Son, them be alſo glorifies, Rom.</hi> 9.30.) upon the paction paſt betwixt the Father and the Son about the Elect, that the Father ſhall bring them to Chriſt, and that Chriſt ſhall loſe none of them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. Upon the Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, that he will put his fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. And upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt, that hath prayed for them <hi>that their faith fail not, Luke</hi> 22.32. Yet though it be certain that none
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47356:120"/>
of the truly Regenerat can totally and finally fall away: it is as certain that Temporaries, that bloſſom fair for a time, may totally and finally fall away: and it is no leſs certain that Saints may make Apoſtaſie, and fall away from many degrees of that life and vigour which once they had; They may with <hi>David</hi> give over waiting on God, and run away to the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>

               </gap>7. They may with that Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> forſake their firſt Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. Nor 3. ſhall I inſiſt to lay before you the evil of Apoſtaſie, that is, the prejudice this back-ſliding hath with it, according to the degree and meaſure of it, as that there is firſt this woful ill in it, in being hindred in that which is good. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Ye run well, who hindred you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth.</hi> And 2. That there is in it a loſing of that which folks have gained, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.4. Have ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain? Have ye loſt all theſe ſufferings ye endured in the world for Chriſtianity? and 2 <hi>Joh. verſe</hi> 8. Look to your ſelves that we loſe not theſe things that have been wrought; The progreſs that hath been made, the victory that hath been obtained over cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a man by Apoſtaſy, back-ſliding or ſitting up in the way of God, runs the hazard of loſing all that. There it alſo 3. a great hazard in Back-ſliding, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the indignity thereby offered to the Majeſty of God, it is a reflection on him, as if there were ſome ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me, and have walked after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and are become vain?</hi> And verſe 31. <hi>Have I been a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to Iſrael? a land of darkneſs? Werefore ſay my people, we are lords, we will come no more to thee;</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> 6.3. <hi>O my people wherein have I wearied thee? What have I done unto thee? teſtifie againſt me.</hi> From all which it is clear, that it is a dreadful iniquity offered to the Majeſty of God, when his people back-ſlide from him. And 4. This courſe of Apoſtaſie is full of hazard, upon the account of the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks thereby laid in the way of others; the back-ſlider
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47356:120"/>
does all that he can to deter any to aſſay that courſe and way of Religion and Godlineſs, that he hath forſaken and turned his back on, when after he hath been for a time in Chriſt's company, he makes deſertion and leaves him, he proclaims to all the World, that there is not that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to be had in him, and in his ſervice that he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if all ſhould take his verdict, never one ſhould ingage in that courſe that he hath relinquiſhed. And 5. Apoſtaſie and back-ſliding is full of hazard, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the dreadful conſequences that follow on it. I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>The back-ſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways;</hi> but many and dreadful are the plagues that abide ſuch a temper, that waits on back-ſliders; God will make out upon tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry back-ſliders, that which ye have 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>It had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment delivered to them;</hi> and for the Saints when they back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide, they lay a foundation of many ſorrows to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when God wakens them up to lay to heart their backſlidings, and to return to their firſt Husband, when he hedges up their way with Thorns, and makes a wall that they ſhall not find their paths, when they follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their lovers, and cannot overtake them, ſeek them and cannot find them, till they find that iniquity of their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding to be hateful.</p>
            <p>Running through theſe words ſhortly, I come to draw ſome words of uſe from what hath been ſaid: And 1. Folk would look what guilt may be among them, or upon them, of this kind; if I ſhould ſpeak to many in this time, there needs not a ſecret ſearch to find out their guilt, to prove their Apoſtaſie, and back-ſliding. How many are there that in their younger days, it may be had their buds, bloſſoms, and promiſes fair enough, and appearances of good, which when they are grown up, are rotten and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, blaſted and gone. How many ſeem to have come

far on in Religion, and all the length they came in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, they have given it over? How many made a mint of ſeeking God in ſecret, and in their Families, and now they no more aſſay it, than if they were Pagans? What ſhall I ſay of Negatives? many have not only tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off all Religion in their Practice, but they are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned openly profane, and not only profane, but mockers, if ever they had any touch of Conſcience in themſelves, they are ready to call it Melancholy, ſillineſs, ſordid baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpirit, and to bleſs themſelves that they have got their foot on it, and not only are they ready to mock at this work in themſelves, but to hate all others that will not run with them to the ſame exceſs of riot; look to it, it is a fearful and ominous thing to ſee the defection that is in this generation, among the generality of the Profeſſors of the Goſpel; and without all peradventure, if Repentance prevent not, it portends hard things; Backſliding is a ſin that Chriſt will not ſit with unrevenged; and ſhall I in this tryal come nearer to you, ye who have keeped your feet, and are not to be ranked among theſe that we have been ſpeaking of, come and try if ye may inliſt your ſelves among the waiters on God, or if ye be backſlidden and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up; I confeſs there may be a temptation as to this, haunting a tender ſoul; ſome may think becauſe they make not ſuch din and noiſe of their Religion as ſometime they did, that they are backſlidden, but thou may have more life now than thou had in thy former frazineſs and forwardneſs; thou was before like green wood that has much din, will crack much, but hath leſs heat and light, but now thou art like the dry wood that has better light and more heat; and there may be alſo a miſtake on this account, that becauſe God is leading thee through the abominations of thine heart, and humbleth thee with the naughtineſs of thy diſpoſition, which he diſcovers to thee; thou may think thy ſelf worſe than ſometime thou was, when thou art not worſe, but ſees better than thou did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47356:121"/>
therefore where there is tenderneſs we would guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch miſtakes upon that hand, where tenderneſs lies. But alas, we have greater cauſe to guard againſt a blind upon the other hand, that is, that becauſe folk keep up the tale of Duty, and are as frequently about Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances as they wont to be, they think they are not back-ſlidden, nor ſitten up in the way of God; and yet they are far from that love to, and delight in God, that once appeared in their Service and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>And to inſtruct this a little to you, I would have theſe that would try if they be backſlidden from that they had, or might have had, or that others have attained, looking to theſe four or five things. 1. If they be growing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17.— <hi>Beware leſt being led away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs, but grow in grace, &amp; in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> There is no ſtanding ſtill in a Chriſtian courſe, the perſon that is not growing in the fruit, or to the root, that is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king progreſs in Sanctification, nor is not growing in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Humiliation for his ſhortcoming, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a backſliding perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would have folks looking to this, whether Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in many be not come from their hearts to their heads, ſo that theſe who wont to be full of ſap, are now ſapleſs; theſe who had a lively impreſſion on their Souls, of the life and power of Religion, are now come to that, that all they have is bare taſtleſs notions &amp; ſpeculations; not only do folks that are ſitten up, forget to look to the frame of the heart, and few cabinet counſels are betwixt God &amp; them; but O how taſteleſs, ſapleſs, &amp; lifeleſs is Religion &amp; Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties to them, they have a notion of Miſery and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of Sin and a Saviour, but it is like a dream, a thing they can look on with very little or no affecting of heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would have folk that would try their frame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, what Conſcience is made of ſin, when the ſaints are in a right frame, they walk tenderly in a continual
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47356:122"/>
jealouſie of themſelves, they have many a reflex look back, check, and heart-ſinking for this and that they find amiſs, and this is not at a ſtart, but it will be their trade and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exciſe: But O when it comes to this, that thou art a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to a tender walk with God, to inward checks and challenges, and thy Throat grows wide, and thou gets o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver guilt without reluctancy, thou miſcarries, and thy light tells thee of it, but thy heart is not affected with it, that tells thou art ſitten up, for a growing frame is tender in the matter of ſin and guilt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I would have folk that would try their frame, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well to their diligence, <hi>It is the hand of the diligent that makes rich, Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The ſoul of the diligent ſhall be made fat, Prov.</hi> 13.4. And therefore folks that are at little pains in the Duties of Religion, for the honour of God, and their own ſouls advantage, but ſpend much of their time in lazineſs, and carnalneſs, when they caſt up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, they will find they are ſitten up, withered and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a decay.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And to add no more, They that would try their frame, would conſider, that though they be free of theſe things hinted at; yet if they be under a ſpirit of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, they cannot be making progreſs. Look then to your frame, who are more tender, what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ye find in it. The day was when the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion, and cloſs following of Chriſt was thy delight; but now thy Conſcience is turned a Tormenter unto thee; thou drives heavily in any task thou art called to, thou art like <hi>Thomas, Joh.</hi>

            <p>Well then, try your ſelves by theſe things, what your growth is, what your heart-work is, what conſcience is made of ſin, what diligence in Duty, what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47356:123"/>
are where they were, and do not amend; a Phyſitian that would cure a Diſeaſe, ſeeks firſt to know and remove the cauſes thereof; and that is the method I would recommend to you to follow, to conſider what it is that makes the people of God back-ſlide, ſit up, or decline in the courſe of Religion and Godlineſs; there are ſome Cauſes without, which I do not inſiſt on, when there is a dreadful ſhower of Spiritual Plagues rain'd upon a viſible Church; it is no wonder that ſome drops of it fall upon the godly; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the love of many ſhall wax cold,</hi> Though I know the meaning of the place looks like another way, that becauſe of the abounding of iniquity, folks ſhall not know with whom to walk, or intimatly converſe; nor ſhall I need to put you in mind of that new-fangle humor that is in many, That when Religion is new to them, make a faird at it, and thereafter ſit up, like Children that are taken up with Toyes, and preſently loſe conceit of them, and caſt them from them; ſo it is with many in the matters of God and godlineſs; but there are ſeveral cauſes of upſitting within, that ye would look unto; The firſt I begin at is, Conceit, which not only many time evidences a man to be nothing, <hi>If a man thinketh himſelf ſomething while he is nothing, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf, Gal.</hi> 6.3. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not, that thou art wretched, poor, blind, miſerable, and naked;</hi> But be a man what he will, if he conceit of it, his conceit of it ſets his height upon his head, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make proficiency, yea, Conceit is the next door to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie; compare for this, theſe two paralel places, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. his ſoul that is lifted up, is not upright in him, <hi>but the juſt ſhall live hy faith, but if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. A lifted up Soul, and a drawing back Soul go together; therefore who would recover from their backſlidden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and find out the cauſes of it, they would look firſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47356:123"/>
to conceit as a main cauſe. O! how many a fair profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath Conceit blaſted? how many a hypocrite hath conceit diſcovered to be but empty casks without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? yea more, how many really godly hath conceit loſt in the mire of apoſtaſie, till they conſidered and laid it to heart better than they did. 2. (Which hath affinity with the former of conceit) Take notice of carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as another great cauſe; when ever a Child of God wears out of a poſture of poor and needy dependence, when all beſide Chriſt is not fleſh to him, a ſlide abides him. When <hi>Job</hi> (29.18.) ſaid <hi>he ſhould die in his neſt, and multiply his days as the ſand,</hi> he was near a ſhake. When <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 30.6. ſaid, <hi>in his proſperity he ſhould not be moved;</hi> God hid his face and he was troubled, his carnal confidence was backed with deſertion from God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beware of pride and carnal confidence, as ye would not decline and backſlide: And ye that would ſeek out the cauſes of your decayed condition, and endeavour a cure, look well to theſe two, as bringing you in the ſad poſture wherein ye are lying. <hi>The Lord bleſs his word to you.</hi>

               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:47356:124"/>For the general I ſpoke ſomewhat to it, and hinted in the firſt place, at ſome Means of Tryal, whereby folks may know more diſtinctly their ſitten-up frame, and I was cut off by the time, from ſearching into the cauſes of up-ſitting or declining, that would be heeded by them that would prevent, or recover themſelves out of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſeveral things occur, which though divers of them may be one upon the matter, yet I name them diſtinctly, that under one notion or another of the ſame thing, ye may take up your diſtemper.</p>
            <p>I ſpoke in the firſt place to Conceit: And, 2. To car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Confidence, as main Cauſes of Apoſtaſie; Now I go on, and in the third place ye ſhall take notice with me of this, as a great cauſe of declining, to wit, idleneſs, want of ſeriouſneſs and ſenſible errands to Chriſt dayly, when folks, though they go about the Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in privat and publick, yet the moſt they have for them is to fill the field, to obſerve a cuſtom, or to quiet the clamours of Conſcience; in this caſe folk are idle, they have not ſenſible errands to Chriſt, they have not their finger on their ſore; and as this evidences a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined Frame ſo it is a cauſe of declining in many, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19 15. <hi>Slothfulneſs caſteth into a deep ſleep, and an idle ſoul ſhall ſuffer hunger:</hi> And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.18. <hi>By much ſlothfulneſs the building decayeth, and through idleneſs of the hands, the houſe droppeth through.</hi> So negligence in performance of Service to God, will ſoon bring a ſoul to a very poor poſture and condition.

            <p>And to this I ſhall add in the 5 place, that folks would look well to Idols, when they are harboured; it's a great cauſe of backſliding, and of idleneſs, and inadvertance, that brings on decay: If <hi>Judas</hi> love the bag, he will ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later betray his Maſter for money: If <hi>Sampſon</hi> will try concluſions, by ſleeping on the knees of a <hi>Delilah,</hi> though he might once and again eſcape her ſnares, yet <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> will at laſt betray him into the hands of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines:</hi> An Idol entertained, without mourning over it, and labouring to mortifie it; though Satan may let thee keep up a rank in good for a time, yet ſooner or later it will turn thee aſide.</p>
            <p>Then 6. If we would perſevere and not decline, we would lay the foundation very well, ſee that it be upon the Rock: It was not that which was above ground that carried the body of naughtineſs in the ſtony ground, but it was the deepneſs of earth that was wanting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.5. The houſe that bides the ſtorm hath the foundation bigged deep, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.48. Many folk are fair above ground, but O! How naughty are they under ground? That's a good foundation that's laid in mortification, ſelf-denial, and needy dependance on Chriſt: This hath relation to what I ſpoke before of idols, and am to ſpeak of unbelief; yet I give it you diſtinctly, an ill-rooted Profeſſor cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, but muſt decline, a mortified Profeſſor will
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47356:125"/>
be well-rooted, and long-breathed (as we uſe to ſpeak) in perſeverance.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Look upon unbelief and diſcouragement as a great cauſe of Apoſtacy, the joy of the Lord is the ſtrength of the Saints, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. But where this evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is, there will be a departing from the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. And where there are hands hanging down, and feeble knees, that which is lame or halting will be ſoon turned out of the way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13. As many ſuffer ſhipwrack of their purſuit in the boſome of ſome Idol, ſo many ſplit upon the Rock of Diffidence and Diſcouragement, which being given way to, there is no remedy, but to fall by, or ſit up dangerouſly.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And <hi>I</hi> ſhall add no mo, we would look well to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as a great cauſe of Apoſtacy and declining. When a man ſtumbleth at the directions of the word, though alas! There are many of us not ſo tenty at a Sermon, as to notice them, or ſhall take them, not ſo near them, as to try if they have corruption, to ſtumble at them, compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60, 61. with 66. Many of Chriſts Diſciples, when they have heard him ſpeak of the <hi>eating of his fleſh, and drinking of his blood,</hi> ſay, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> Chriſt knowing their murmuring, ſaith, <hi>Doth this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you?</hi> And what comes of that? <hi>v.</hi> 66. <hi>From that time many of his diſciples went back, and walked no more with him;</hi> they ſtumbled at his Doctrine, and therefore drew back: or whether folk ſtumble at the diſpenſations of providence, when they are ſad and afflicting, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.14. It is ſaid of the Hypocrites, <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurpriſed the hypocrites: who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Alluding to the terrible aſpect of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army; they looked on theſe as things that could not be bidden: ye may think them weak, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, that ſtumble at diſpenſations, but <hi>let him that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47356:125"/>
ſtands, take heed lest he fall.</hi> Remember when <hi>David</hi> ſtumbled at the proſperity of the wicked, he came to that, <hi>How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the moſt high? Verily I have cleanſed my hands in vain, and waſhen my hands in innocency.</hi> There ſtumbling at providence turned him fooliſh and ignorant, as a beaſt before God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73 22.—</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have ſhortly named, and if there be any ſenſible of their backſliding, and of a decayed frame, and afraid of it; do not think that your whryning over it will prevent it, or cure it, but look on thoſe things as the cauſes of this ill frame, and ye will find ye have them, or are ready to ſplit on them; and to cure the diſeaſe, take away the cauſe and the effect will ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But a 3d word of Uſe ſhall be this, if declining and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding be ſo frequent, and where it is, if it be ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, how much reaſon have they to bleſs God, whoſe backſliding he prevents, who are kept freſh and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fat and green, and enabled to bring forth fruit in old age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12.— Who in all the times they have come over, have not met with an Idol they delight to fall aſleep in the boſome of, nor with a diſcouragement that they have not trode on, nor with a diſpenſation they ſtumbled on; they have been kept ſerious and diligent, humble and denyed. I am now marking a mercy of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it may be they do not mark themſelves; ſome complain, that all their time they get nothing, they are kept poor and needy, from the hand to the mouth, they meet with nothing but delays, toſſing and reſtleſsneſs, any get leave to draw their breath but they, and they think that they are very hardly dealt with; but haſt thou this mercy, that thou art kept low, thou has no ground of carnal confidence, thou gets not leave to be idle, thou art holden going, diligent, ſerious in errands to Chriſt. Thy grievances will tell thee if thou bide away; thy heart-ſearchings thou muſt vent in his boſome, and ſhew before
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47356:126"/>
him thy trouble: Read in that a mercy, that thou art made to perſevere, though in a humbling poſture. Many have had ſweet hours beſide thee, and have fallen aſleep on them, and thou art kept waking; God is keeping thee on thy feet, when others have fallen, though with diſpenſations that are not ſatisfying to thy fleſh.</p>
            <p>But now I proceed to the other two looks that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be taken of this perſeverance, which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the former, and ſerve to obviat two great ſources and cauſes of Apoſtacy. The firſt is this, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is to be looked on, as it imports a conſtant tract of waiting on God, and ſeeking of him, in oppoſition to that braſhineſs fleettingneſs, ups and downs that are in ſome, who will have ſome odd fits of godlineſs, they are now very hot, and ere ye wot as cold: This may be ſeen in very godly folks, if they be at Ordinances, eſpecially ſolemn Ordinances, how far up the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will they be, as <hi>Saul</hi> among the Prophets? Or when they are in ſome trouble, how keen, how eager and lively will they be? But ere ye wot they are as dead, like a Summer Brook, that in a ſhower is over the Banks, but within a little is quite out and dry. Ye may take an inſtance of this in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Law was publiſh'd at <hi>Sinai,</hi> with great Majeſty and terrour, who but they? <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.27. <hi>All that the Lord our God will ſpeak unto thee, we will do it:</hi> But the Hiſtory tells if they were as good as their word. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance ye have in <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the red Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12.— <hi>Then believed they his word, and ſang his praiſe, when the waters overflowed their enemies; but they ſoon forgot his works,</hi> or made haſte to forget them, <hi>they waited not for his counſel, but lusted exceedingly in the wilderneſs, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted God in the deſart.</hi> Now in oppoſition to this, it's the great mercy of Saints, when not only they hold out as it may be to the end, and get their ſouls for a prey, but they endeavour to be ſolid, fixed, conſtant, equal, to draw
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47356:126"/>
out (as ye ſpeak) an even threed of a godly walk; not but that they have their ups and downs of comfort and abaſement, but they guard againſt their braſhy fairds and fits, and againſt their being at a hight now, and ſinking again as low.</p>
            <p>And the grounds why ye would guard againſt this fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſtable diſpoſition are, 1. A fleeting temper is not to be truſted to; that which light unſolid hearts are at in a faird, they are not wiſe that lean to it. God at the firſt view tells <hi>Iſrael, their goodneſs was as a morning cloud, or as the early dew,</hi> Hoſ. 6.4. promiſing fair, but paſſing away: And when they make their great ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This fleeting diſpoſition would be guarded againſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe hot fits that folk ſometimes have in the way of godlineſs, will be a dreadful witneſs againſt them, when they turn their back upon it. What a ſad check is that Chriſt gives to the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35. John <hi>was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye rejoyced to walk in his light for a ſeaſon;</hi> Who but <hi>John</hi> for a time to you? but ye ſoon ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And ſee how the Apoſtle beats home a reproof for this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14.— <hi>My temptation which was in my fleſh ye despiſed not, nor rejected; but received me as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus. Where is then the bleſſedneſs ye spake of?</hi> &amp;c. Where is that heat and edge now? 3. This fleeting diſpoſition would be look'd to, becauſe theſe unſolid fits have no preſent acceſs and acceptation, as they are not laſty, ſo they are little noticed for the time: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee? for your goodneſs is as a morning cloud,</hi> &amp;c.

This fleeting humour would be guarded againſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (beſides, it's not acceptance with God) it keeps folk that they know not the good of godlineſs: It's not fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that profeſſed to believe on Chriſt, he ſaith to them, <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed, and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free;</hi> if ye hold at that which ye profeſs, ye ſhall find the good of Religion, and be Diſciples to me.</p>
            <p>From all that I have been ſpeaking on this, folks would learn not to be cheated with braſhes and fairds of this kind; it may be folks pleaſe themſelves in an ill courſe, becauſe now and then their minds have been under dwams, and they have had their fits and motions (and they ſhould beware of ſlighting theſe, leſt folks be given over to their own hearts luſts, to walk in their own counſels) but ſuch folk ſhould look to it, ye that are braſhie, either hot and frazie, or key cold: There is much of this in a natural temper, that in ſome ſkips from hot to cold, from livelineſs to deadneſs, and holds at nothing. But that ye may learn to be ſtill the ſame, in ſo far as is attainable, in this ſtate of miſery, I would recommend to you partly, that ye would labour to fix your ſelves on rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; know what ye are doing, and the grounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ye go, when ye cloſe with Religion; be as <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 6.68 — When many went back, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to whom ſhall we go? for thou haſt the words of eternal life. And we believe, and are ſure that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> Stuff thine heart ſolidly with rational and ſolid grounds to go upon in Religion, and theſe put in the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47356:129"/>
hand of God, will be a conſtant ſpring to feed thy diligence. 2. To theſe rational grounds, add ſolid reſolutions, that (as <hi>Barnabas</hi> perſwaded the Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23.) Thou may with full purpoſe of heart cleave unto the Lord; it muſt not be a ſurpriſal, like one in a paſſion, that ſets thee on to ſeek God, but a ſolid, fix'd purpoſe of heart: And when thou haſt laid down rational grounds, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſolid reſolutions, thou muſt in the 3d place wait on God; it's he that muſt unite thy heart to fear his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. It's he that can gather the fleeting heart, and fix it on the nail that's faſtened in a ſure place; It's he in whoſe hand thou muſt put all thy reſolutions and purpoſes, as <hi>David,</hi> who when he hath reſolved well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.3.— <hi>Thou haſt tried me, and ſhalt find nothing: I have purpoſed that my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſs. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the works of men, I have by the words of thy lips kept me from the paths of the deſtroyer.</hi> He adds, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footſteps ſlip not.</hi> Theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions that are ſettled and backed with needy depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on God; elſe though thou were never ſo well fixt in thy reſolutions, they may prove like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Cords, when thou art aſſaulted with a new temptation. Theſe few directions through the bleſſing of God, may fix you in the way of godlineſs, prevent fleeting unconſtancy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bording and deviating from it.</p>
            <p>But now in the 3d place, to give you a look of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as it is oppoſed to wearying, lying by, ſitting up, and it may be, the taking of many ſinful ſhifts on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes; and when difficulties are met with, that is, when a needy perſon goes about the means, frequents the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and gets nothing, his Word is a ſealed Book, the Preaching of the Goſpel is under a Cloud: when they go to God in Prayer, they come no ſpeed, they are not heard, and it may be wrath meets them in the teeth, ſuch may be ſtrongly tempted to give over and weary; and it's in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47356:130"/>
to this, the Pſalmiſt will wait on God, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſuch temptations, we are to fix this truth, that no delay we meet with in Gods way, ought to cut our perſeverance ſhort. No delay ſhould make us ſay with that wicked King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> And readily the man that will not wait on God, hath that which he had with it, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if the head of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> were it never ſo long, till the water be troubled, and ſome put him in; or till Chriſt by his immediat hand cure him: This was the Pſalmiſts way here, after he is put to cry out of the deeps, and to wreſtle with guilt meeting him in the teeth, and to cry for pardoning mercie, and no relief appears, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves during the delay, to wait on God. <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope: My ſoul waits for the Lord, more,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Pſal</hi> 62. after he hath ſaid, <hi>Truly my ſoul waiteth on God, from him comes my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, v.</hi> 1. he preſſeth it over again, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>O my ſoul, wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him;</hi> he will wait, and better wait, and continue in waiting.</p>
            <p>Now the proſecution of this would lead me to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in the Text, wherein theſe four or five things are clear. 1. The Pſalmiſts exerciſe, <hi>I wait.</hi> 2. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his exerciſe of waiting. <hi>I wait for the Lord.</hi> 3. His affection in waiting, <hi>My ſoul doth wait.</hi> 4. His ſupport in his waiting, <hi>My ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</hi> 5. The great meaſure of his affection in waiting, <hi>My ſoul waits for the Lord, more than they that watch for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: I ſay, more,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the particulars in the Text, in the proſecution whereof, we may have ſundry things for laying open this exerciſe of waiting on God; I ſhall now ſpeak a few words, and cloſe. I ſhall not touch
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47356:130"/>
on this, that duty is ours, and event is Gods; a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done his duty, may, if he could win up to the uſe of his allowance, ſleep very ſound under croſs events, but it is our unhappy temper, that we would ſtill be at the Throne, and have the guiding of things: we are like the ill Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that's buſier at his neighbours Leſſon than his own. But to paſs this, conſider four ſhort words, and I have done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing on God is a bleſt mean appointed of God, in order to an out-gate out of all difficulties. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.18. <hi>Bleſt are all they that wait on him.</hi> A man by waiting on God, and brooking delays with faith, patience, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſubmiſſion, may find an out gate without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Waiting on God in the caſe of delays, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in waiting, is commendable on this account, that we can do no where elſe ſo well, as to ly ſtill at his door; a man that wearies to wait on God, would look what he will do next, ere he give it over. When Chriſt aſk'd <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Will ye alſo leave me?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>To whom shall we go?</hi> We had need to ſeek a better Maſter ere we quite thee, and that we cannot find, <hi>thou hast the words of eternal life.</hi> What will a man do next, if he wait not on God? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is faſht with waiting and dependence, and he will go down to the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> and the Hiſtory tells what befell him there, he is forced to lie, he is likely to be brought in a ſnare, by fighting againſt the people of God and his intereſt, and in <hi>Ziglag,</hi> in hazard of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> a man may well get an ill Conſcience by apoſtacy and declining, he is never a ſtep nearer delivery, ſo that go the world as it will, waiting on God is the beſt of it.</p>
            <p>And 3. When we weary of waiting on God, becauſe of outward diſpenſations, we bewray too much affection to the things of time, thou art in a difficulty, &amp; thou wearies becauſe of the calamity that lies on, and thou gets not an

            <p>IN theſe words (as ye heard the laſt day) is contained the 3d Branch of the Pſalmiſts exerciſe, after that he hath wreſtled with difficulties, by crying to God out of the depths, and wreſtled with the conſcience of guilt, by taking with it, and fleeing to pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on right terms, he is put now to wreſtle with delays of comfort, and an out-gate; and this he wreſtles with by confident, affectionat, meek and patient waiting on God. I ſpoke to the general Doctrine of this Verſe, The taſk of perſeverance and conſtancy in the way of God, and followed it out a little, in oppoſition to apoſtacy and back-ſliding, and more particularly, to theſe braſhy, hot fits, that folk have at ſome times, which are followed with as great cools, and in oppoſition to delays, or weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſitting up from employing God, when folks meet with delays which is in the Text, which ye may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I divided in theſe five; 1.

<list>
                  <item>1. Somewhat Suppoſed, That he is put <hi>to wait.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Somewhat propoſed, That when he is put <hi>to wait,</hi> he doth <hi>wait.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, ſomewhat ſuppoſed, that he is put <hi>to wait,</hi> which affords us this Obſervation, that the Saints even in their ſerious and ſincere ſeeking of God in difficulties, may be exerciſed with delays of comfort, and an out-gate; when a godly man is here crying out of the Depths; when he has not only been looking upon his trouble, but ſenſible of ſin, and following a right method for pardon of ſin, on right Terms, carefully and diligently going about his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he is put to this, <hi>I wait for the Lord.</hi> The Lord indeed hath made many rich and precious Promiſes, relative to every preſſure his people can be under, there is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs or difficulty they can be in, but there is a Promiſe for it, yet he hath reſerved the timing of the accompliſhment, and performing of them in his own hand, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60. <hi>ult. and it is not for us to know the times and the ſeaſons which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put in his own power;</hi> &amp; hence it comes to paſs, that though the Lord in fulfilling his Promiſes, never miſſes his own time, yet ſeldom doth he come at our time; we by reaſon of our corruption and weakneſs, are often put to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47356:132"/>
cry, <hi>How long, Lord? how long? Pſal.</hi> 6.3. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me? how long wilt thou hide thy face? Pſal.</hi> 13.1. And as it is. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.20. <hi>The harveſt is paſt, the Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved:</hi> All which complaints do not import that God keeps not his time, but that he comes not at our time in performing his Promiſes; and yet further, this is to be taken along with us, during our being exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with delays; that though God put us <hi>to wait,</hi> he doth not that meerly on the account of his Soveraignty (though he might do ſo,) but for the exerciſe, profit, and advantage of his people: and to clear and make out this, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it in four ends the Lord hath before him, in delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fulfilling of Promiſes till his own time; 1. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord trys whether we will believe the thing he hath promiſed, though it be delayed; it is not the tryal of Faith when we ſee rich and precious Promiſes meeting with ſad times and caſes, to cloſe with them, providing God will let us ſee them preſently accompliſhed when we would; but here is the tryal of Faith, if we will wait till Gods time come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. After the Apoſtle hath plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that hope ſeen is not hope, for what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for?</hi> he adds <hi>but if we wait for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it:</hi> If we hope to get the thing promiſed, though we ſee it not, then it will kythe in our patient waiting for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord by delaying his people, ſearches them, whether there be any latent and hidden droſs in them, or not. It is not the firſt heat of the furnace that will try what is in the Saints, neither is it ſo much the greatneſs of the Tryal, as the lengthning of it, that will ſift them, and diſcover what is in them: When men at firſt ingage in Tryal, and have the Promiſes before them, and their blood hot, their whole ſpirit will go along with them; but ſtay till their blood cool, till Temptation ſeek and ſoak in, till diſappointment give them a daſh after daſh, and till year after year, and day after day, ſays the matter is hopeleſs,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47356:132"/>
and that will bring out that which folks did not believe was within; who would have believed the corruption and weakneſs that kythed in <hi>David?</hi> if the lengthning of his trouble had not diſcovered it; <hi>all men are liars,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall now one day periſh by the hand of Saul;</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for me, than <hi>that I ſhould ſpeedily eſcape into the land of the Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lord delays his people, that when they have ſtudied Faith and Patience, and have reſolved upon it as their duty, to give God his own time for performing his Promiſes, they may have acceſs to the bleſſed Fruit that comes in at that door, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, patience experience,</hi> &amp;c. There are two remarkable things in that Text, one is, That the bleſſing of God on cankering, fretting, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Tribulation, can make it a mean in his hand to bring forth Patience. That which puts folk out of tune, he cannot only make it fit on their back till they ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden; but through his bleſſing on it, he can work them up to patience by it. And another is, that till a perſon ſtudy Patience under Tribulation, he ſtops the door on all the good he might get by it, or meet with under it; it is but tint labour till he win to patience, but when Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath wrought Patience, Patience worketh Experience.</p>
            <p>And 4. (To add no more) The Lord delays his people, that he may wean them from Time, and theſe things they are given to dote upon in time. Although in time they be tryſted with many needful encouragements, with Meats in their journey, in paſſing through the Wilderneſs; yet he will have them to know that their home is not here, that their Reſt is not in time; therefore he ſo trains on his people in Time, as they find no place for ſatisfaction in it, but that they muſt feed on hunger and thirſt, and ſo go on, ſeeking for that Reſt that abides them beyond Time; That is one of the great Leſſons that God incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats on his people by delays, even to wean them more
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47356:133"/>
from Time, and to make them fall in love with Eternity.</p>
            <p>Well then, ſeing it is ſo, Take four words of Inference from it, and I ſhall leave it.</p>
            <p>And 1. The godly that are ſeeking God ſincerely, and ſeriouſly, would hence be Cautioned not to judge of their ſincerity and diligence, by their preſent ſucceſs, comfort, or out-gate; here is a man <hi>crying to God out of the depths, verſe</hi> 1, 2. Taking with guilt, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. gripping to pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy on right terms, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. And yet here he is put <hi>to wait,</hi> in oppoſition to delays. It is a groundleſs Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to meaſure divine approbation by preſent ſucceſs; here we ſee folk may be acceptably employed, and yet meet with delays; but this may occur afterward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I here paſs it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence ye ſhall gather, that if the Lord delay a man in the poſture that this holy man was, in crying, ſerious in Prayer, in taking with guilt, in pleading for pardon; what wonder he delay others, who under difficulties are not ſo exerciſed? much more theſe who are at no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, are not to think it ſtrange, though they meet with ſuch delays; What wonder the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity laſt for ſeventy years, when at the cloſe of it, it might be ſaid, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12. <hi>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and underſtand thy truth.</hi> The carriage of the viſible Church is ſuch, as it juſtifies God in bringing on trouble. <hi>Ezek,</hi> 14.22. — He tells his people, <hi>when the remnant ſhould be brought forth, and they ſhould ſee their ways and doings, they ſhould be comforted concerning all the evil that he had brought upon Jeruſalem, and ſhould know that he had not done without cauſe, all that he had done in it:</hi> And doth not the evil improvement of Trouble, and folks ſecurity and negligence under trouble, juſtifie God in the long continuance of trouble? when we are ready to cry, <hi>how long, Lord? how long ſhall this calamity laſt?</hi> The Lord may retort it upon us, <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> For
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47356:133"/>
as it is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.10. The Lord may ſay, <hi>They are not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law:</hi> A ſight of this, that God keeps a ſincere ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous godly man ſo long waiting on, under delays, for comfort and out-gate, may ſilence the clamors of them who are not yet begun to think on a ſuitable walk under their troubles, and the right improvement of them.</p>
            <p>But 3. If the Lord, for the ends before-mentioned, may long delay his people, and keep them waiting in trouble, take heed that Faith, the great ſupport of Patience, fail not in that exigent, as I told you in the deducing of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: the great thing tryed in the people of God under delays, is their Faith, whether they will believe his word; and therefore when Faith is tryed, look that it be not found droſſie; when Faith is weighed, ſee that it be not found light; I ſpeak it, becauſe <hi>I</hi> find the Faith of the Saints has gotten ſore ſhakes under delays, when they have been put to wait on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, all men</hi> (<hi>Samuel, Gad,</hi> and others that had told me. I ſhould come to the Crown and Kingdom) <hi>are liars;</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.18. while ſpeaking to God, hath a dreadful word, when he reflects on the Promiſes God made to be with him in his Miniſtry, ſays he, <hi>Wilt thou be to me altogether as a liar, and as waters that fail?</hi> When we find ſo ſtrong Cedars ſo ſhaken, we would look well to it, that our Faith be not brangled; and that Faith be not brangled, we would beſide, be looking well to the Atheiſm of our hearts, (for there is a ſeed of Atheiſm in every boſom;) that if the Lord put us hardly to it, and make not out that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.10. <hi>I have refined thee, but not with ſilver, I have choſen thee in the furnace of affliction;</hi> It may put us to tremble, what ſtuff may boil up in our hearts; and they are not ſicker in the matter of their Faith, that are not mourning over their heart-atheiſm: but beſide that (I ſay) we would guard againſt wrong conceptions of the Promiſe, as that wherein the great ſtumbling lies, as to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47356:134"/>
this matter, when we conceive more to be in the Promiſe than we are allowed, and make a carnal Commentar on a Spiritual Text; and (as the ſaying is) <hi>The Bell to clink as the fools think:</hi> As alſo, we would beware of limiting God to our time, but give him his own time to make good his Promiſes. Theſe that are not mourning over the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm of their heart, that are not cautious in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promiſes a-right, and are not leaving God to his own time for performing them, may take a ſnapper in their Faith, when tryals are continued.</p>
            <p>But a fourth word of <hi>Uſe</hi> ſhall be this; That ye would learn to read Gods delays aright; delays make diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that is the exerciſe of many folk, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.15. <hi>We looked for peace, but no good came, and for a time of healing, but behold trouble;</hi> But if thou would read aright Gods delays; I ſhall ſhortly offer thee theſe four, and wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderers will find them to be the work of the generation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If thou read delays aright, thou will find that God calls thee to exerciſe, and that, the beſt thing within thee; as in a ſtorm, beſt Anchors and Ropes, and the beſt things of the Ship are brought out; ſo in a Trial, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, he calls thee to exerciſe the beſt things in thy boſom, and if God call thee to exerciſe Grace, bring not out Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; though at firſt thou may caſt a ſcum of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Grace is to be brought out afterwards; If he call for Affection, meet not his Call with Bitterneſs; if he call to Diligence, do not intertain that Call with Idleneſs; remember, God by delays, calls for the exerciſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, affections and diligence in his people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If thou read delays aright, Thou will read, That every days delay is a new Tryal; and I may add, every moments delay is a new Tryal. When thou art carried through the day, thou muſt not take that for ſurety, that thou wilt through the next day without Self-denial, and needy dependance. The day may diſcover that which the foregoing day did not diſcover, and the morrow may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47356:134"/>
that which lies hid this day; and therefore though thou may ſet up one <hi>Ebenezer</hi> at every ſtep of thy way, and ſay, <hi>hither to hath the Lord helped;</hi> Remember, that thou art not yet off the ſtage, and thou muſt not think, becauſe thou art haſted with the Tryal, thou art better buckled to bear it; but know there is ſtill a neceſſity of Self-denial, and needy-dependance, leſt the length of Trial diſcover that, which the greatneſs of the Trial did not diſcover.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If thou would read delays aright, read in them a Call, (as I ſaid in the Explication of the Doctrine) to die to, and to be above Time, and the Conſolations in Time; then men go through Afflictions rightly, when they read <hi>Their light afflictions, which is but for a moment, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while they look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Then men will be patient, and ſtabliſh their hearts, when they conſider that the <hi>coming of the Lord draws near, Jam.</hi> 5.8. In a word, when God exerciſes with delays, that is an uſeful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ye have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. <hi>This I ſay, brethren, the time is ſhort;</hi> (he touches the Glaſs, and lets them ſee it is near run out) It remaineth, that both theſe that have wives, be as though they had none, <hi>they that weep, as though they weeped not, they that rejoyce, as though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced not.</hi> One ſerious look of Time and Eternity, will break many a ſnare that mens Corruptions expoſe them to, while under trouble, they meet with delays.</p>
            <p>But 4. If ye would read delays rightly, this is to be read in them, that well improved delays, are full of rich advantages; Thou art keeped under continued difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and delayed as to comfort, or ſatisfaction external in thy perſonal and privat concerns, and as to what relates to the publick, and it may be thou wins not to inward ſenſible comfort; but if thou were thrifty, thou mayeſt find many things granted in the delay, or denyal of that which thou would be at; as much humility, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47356:135"/>
to Time, and the things of it, communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God; and though ſome particulars be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, if theſe were purſued after, and in any meaſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, times of delay would not be looked on as idle times. A thrifty perſon may make much gain and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage out of theſe delays. So much for what is ſuppon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, that the Saints, even in their ſincere and ſerious ſeeking of God, are exerciſed with delays, as to comfort, or an out-gate under difficulties.</p>
            <p>Follows in the 2. place, that which is propoſed, That when he is put to wait, he doth wait: Hence obſerve, That in the caſe of delays, whether for comfort or an out-gate, it is the duty of Saints to wait on; this will take in all that follows in theſe two <hi>verſes,</hi> and therefore I ſhall firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the import of it, and then preſs the reaſonablneſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and advantages of it.</p>
            <p>For the import of this Duty of Waiting, a waiter on God, when he is delayed, he muſt have theſe three things ſhortly, 1. He muſt have ſomewhat to be the Baſis and Ground of his Waiting, and that is the Faith of the Saints, which prepares the way for the Patience of the Saints, and ſo it follows after in the Text. That a ſoul that waits on God, hopes in the Word of God. The meaning of this ſhortly is, That a waiter on God, when he is delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt not judge of God, by what is preſent; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Word of God, ſo long as God gives him not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Bible (and that will never be) whatever be his preſent caſe, he muſt ſtill look for better: If he have a Cloud, he muſt look that it will ſcatter; if he have a Night, he muſt look for a Day on the back of that Night, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I will wait on the Lord, that hides his face from the houſe of Jacob;</hi> and I will look for him, though he hide his Face at preſent, I will look for better things from him; and <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait on the God of my ſalvation, my God will hear me;</hi> and therefore rejoyce <hi>not over me, O mine enemy, when I fall, I ſhall ariſe, when I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47356:135"/>
ſit in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me;</hi> They muſt firſt look to that, that they caſt not away their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who would have needful Patience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. And, 2 This waiting of the Saints imports, that they having believed the word of Promiſe, they muſt not make haſte, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.16. <hi>He that believes ſhall not make baſte.</hi> They muſt not be haſty; And this is properly the Patience of the Saints, taking it generally, their Patience is the product of Faith. The waiting man muſt attend God's leaſure; as he muſt not quarrel, though the <hi>Jordan</hi> of difficulties in his way ſhould overflow all its Banks; So he muſt not miſtake, though when he is in diſtreſs in the City, he ſhould be ſent out to the field, and when he is in diſtreſs in the field, he ſhould be ſent even to <hi>Babylon</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.10. That is the next ſtep of a Waiter, That when he has believed the Promiſe, he makes no haſte. But 3. In waiting, it is not enough that folks win to hang on, becauſe either they have no other ſhift for help, or their Conſcience will not ſuffer them to take another ſhift; but in the mean time, O how imbittered, broken and cruſht in Spirit are they in waiting, that is not only a ſin in them, but a ſhame to look upon their poſture in waiting, they wait upon God, as if they never had a day to do well in his aught. Therefore in the 3. place I ſay, in waiting ye would beware of fretting, quarrelling, deſpondency of taking the ſnuff in your paſſion; and in waiting, ſtudy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, meekneſs and calmneſs of Spirit, to do it ſweetly. This is the perfect work of Patience, which Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by his own practice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and that ſhall bring reſt to your ſouls.</hi> There is no waiting on without that, that will bring reſt; and that is the waiting in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. throughout, commended to you in a fretful time which ye may read at your own leiſure; and ye have a rich Promiſe <hi>Zeph.</hi>

               </gap>.3. For a ſtormy time, <hi>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>

(the mark of them which he hath a good turn to do to <hi>before the decree bring forth, before the day paſs, as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon the reſt,) Seek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs, it may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger;</hi> Whatever be the proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the place, they ſpeak no Hereſie, who in alluding to it, do recommend to ſeek the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to their perſon, and meekneſs of Spirit, in reference to Diſpenſations, who in times of difficulty, would carry rightly under delays. Theſe are the two notable ſupports of a Pilgrim, the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by inherent Righteouſneſs, and meekneſs and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit; and therefore the Promiſe is made to ſuch, <hi>It may be ye ſhalbe hid in in the day of the Lords anger;</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof is not only, that theſe who are ſtudents of Righteouſneſs and Meekneſs (as indeed they who are ſuch will not be peremptor about events) but it imports fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may take their venture of God, <hi>of being hid in the day of God's anger,</hi> when the ſtorm breaks upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; So ye have had a brief view of what is the import of <hi>waiting on God</hi> under delays, there muſt be Faith as the ground of it, not being haſty of the reſult of Faith, and a meek and calm diſpoſition, and giving God the timing of what he hath Promiſed, or we expect: As for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments preſſing the equity and advantage of it, the time being gone, I ſhall forbear to enter upon them.</p>

            <p>I Am now (as ye may remember) laying before you the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> exerciſe of <hi>waiting on God;</hi> and having in the morning ſpoken to what is ſuppoſed in theſe Words, That the Saints may be put to wait on Gods delaying to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47356:136"/>
perform his promiſes, I came to that which is propoſed, that they ſhould wait; the import whereof I laid open to you in theſe three; There is the faith of the Saints, as the ground of their waiting; There is the patience &amp; waiting on of the Saints, in oppoſition to their being haſty; And there is the meekneſs and calmneſs of their ſpirits, in oppoſition to their fretfulneſs, though they hing on when they are delayed.</p>
            <p>It remains, that I inſiſt a little to commend theſe three unto you: As for Faith, except that I touch it in the paſſing, it will come better in to be ſpoken to afterwards, and therefore I ſhall here ſpeak a word for perſwading you not to be haſty. 2. A word for perſwading you to meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to fret. And 3. I ſhall ſhut up both, with a general word, to perſwade you to this waiting.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, that ye may wait on, and not be haſty under delays, I ſhall offer four conſiderations to perſwade you to it.</p>
            <p>And the 1. (which relates to what I ſpoke before of Faith) is, that ye would remember, that delayed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is not denyed ſucceſs; ſo long as the Word ſpeaks good news, <hi>That the needy ſhall not always be forgotten, that the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever,</hi> Pſal. 9.18. There is no cauſe why <hi>our hearts ſhould envy ſinners, but that our hearts should be in the fear of the Lord all the day long. For ſurely there is an end, and our expectation shall not be cut off,</hi> Prov. 23.17.— So long as the Word ſpeaks thus, we are to bleſs our ſelves in it, that delayed ſucceſs is not denyed ſucceſs, and that therefore all that God hath promiſed, were it never ſo long betwixt the promiſe and the performance, will certainly come to paſs, as is marked in the Book of <hi>Joshua</hi> 23.14. <hi>That of all the good things which the Lord had promiſed</hi> to that people (and many a time there ſeemed to be an utter impoſſibility of the performance of it) <hi>not one thing had failed, but all
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47356:137"/>
did come to paſs.</hi> A man that hath good things laid up for him in the Scripture, though he be put to wait for them, he needs not make a cheap Market of them, they will be found forth-coming to him. And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60 22. <hi>The Lord will hasten it in his time,</hi> which is alway the beſt time, the Lord will afford mercy and grace to help, not when we will, but in the time of need, <hi>Heb</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> He will make out his mercies in the time when they will be found double mercies for their ſeaſonableneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.18. <hi>When I ſaid, My foot ſlippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.</hi> And as he will thus in due time make out all that he hath promiſed, ſo in the mean time he will not deny ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to them that wait on him: it may be he let tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, ſuch as are common to men, ly on: But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>He is faithful, and will not ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able to bear, but will with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on make a way to eſcape,</hi> that they may be able to bear it. It may be, when they are crying for a good account of a meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet them, that he remove it not, but he will make out that, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for you; my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. That then is one Conſideration to perſwade you to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t on, That delayed ſucceſs is not denyed ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This may preſs and perſwade to on-waiting, that if we be doing our duty, we may very ſafely truſt the love and wiſdom of God with the time of doing us good. There are three things which I have had occaſion ſometimes to hint at to you, that I ſhall now reſume, in reference to this. We may and ought to wait, 1. Becauſe God never comes out of time, look things never ſo deſperat-like, to make up all that was looked for; men may come out of ſeaſon, but God never comes out of ſeaſon; although it were come to that, that there were nothing but dry bones in a Valley, he can make theſe dry bones to live, <hi>Ezek</hi> 37. Although there were no Witneſſes left, (And O but it's
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47356:137"/>
ſad to ſee a decay of a faithful Miniſtry, and few laying it to heart; many going off the Stage, and few coming in their room) though they were killed, after three days and an half they ſhall riſe again, and aſcend up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their enemies ſhall behold them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. When thou haſt ſaid, thy ſtrength and thy hope is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed from the Lord, it is as eaſie for him to make all things well, as when thou haſt all probabilities that things ſhall be well. 2. We may ſafely remit the proofs of Gods love to himſelf, if we conſider he never delays ſo long, but we may be getting good of delays. It's true, thou may be ready to tyre, fag and weary, and look on thy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued trial as a lot thou wilt get no good of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon turn idle, or ly down and die; but the longeſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if improven, ſhall <hi>yield the peaceable fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed thereby, Heb.</hi> 12.11. If we were thrifty, we might be getting good of every moments delay. 3. We may and ought to wait and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the wiſdom and love of God, and truſt him for good under our delays, on this account, that he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays ſo long, but he is able to give a ſatisfactory account of his delays. Thou wilt ſay, Why doth he delay ſo long from com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to comfort, or give an out-gate? But he can convince thee with ſatisfying reaſons, that his delays were needful. When (as it is <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.) ſenſe ſays, <hi>The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tarries,</hi> he can make thy faith ſay, <hi>Tarry for it,</hi> becauſe <hi>it will ſurely come, and not tarry;</hi> he can make thy ſelf ſay, he doth not tarry, even when thy ſenſe ſays, he doth tarry. This for the ſecond Conſideration, for perſwading you to wait on God under delays, and not to be haſty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Conſideration to perſwade to waiting, in oppoſition to making haſte, is, That they that are ſweet to wait, would look if they be buſie at work, and at the work they are called to. This is a needful diverſion, which I would offer to ſuch folk, were they buſie in making uſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47356:138"/>
of long and feeding ſtorms, they would make leſs dinn in waiting for an iſſue of them, but they would be ready to ſay rather, Alas, let him tarry never ſo long, he will come ere I be ready for him, ere I have reaped the bleſſed fruit of the diſpenſations of his providence that I am under: And therefore a wearier and a haſty perſon, under delays, doth proclaim that he is an idle perſon, not about his work; for not only (as ye know) work is a mean to take away langour, but in particular, the thrifty improvement of a hard lot, would make folk wonder that God ſhould come to them at all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To perſwade you to wait, and that ye would not be haſty, if none of the former Conſiderations will preſs you to it, remember the Soveraignty of God, and that ye are his Creatures: when thou wearies to wait, conſider what thou art, a bit of nothing, a dependent bit of beeing, to be made or not made, formed or marred at his pleaſure: if he hath given thee a back, why may he not lay on a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and continue it on ſo long as pleaſes him? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerves thy beeing in the world, but to be at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and to be what ſeems good to him. This Argument prevailed with <hi>Job,</hi> that was put otherways to it than any of us, he was ſtripped in an inſtant of all that he had, and ſitting down on the duſt, he ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21 <hi>Naked came I out of the womb, and naked ſhall I return, God gave, and God hath taken, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.10. he ſays to his Wife, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil.</hi> O! there is a ſtooping to Soveraignty in the greateſt ſtraits and ſhakes that ever befell any, except our Lord Jeſus; and that Argument is made uſe of by him to his Diſciples, in the matter of timing mercies, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power:</hi> Proud duſt miſkens it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47356:138"/>
ſelf, when it dare offer to preſcribe to God; and were Soveraignty more ſtudied, and practically improven in the lots that befall us, and in their continuance, we would often find matter of a ſong, where we make a quarrel.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe Conſiderations might preſs waiting, in oppoſition to haſtineſs; ſo there are ſome other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that ſerve to preſs meekneſs and calmneſs of ſpirit, in oppoſition to bitterneſs and fretfulneſs; and among many, I ſhall only name three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meekneſs and ſweetneſs is commendable on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that it takes the poiſon and ſting out of all our lots. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21. when he hath been ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt paſſion and fretfulneſs, at our neighbours that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers us, he hath a very ſpeaking word that he cloſes with, <hi>Be not overcome of evil;</hi> as if he ſaid, ye think your ſelf victorious, when ye have gotten your crop and ſpleen wracked on crowing over them that have wronged you, but ye are far miſtaken, the ſoil is yours, ye are overcome of evil, ye are ſlaves to your own corruption, in venting your paſſion and bitterneſs. So is it here, it's fretfulneſs and bitterneſs that poiſons any ſad lot we are under, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19.— When a man remembers the affliction and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and the wormwood and the gall, and hath them ſtill in remembrance, his ſoul ſinketh in him, but when he gets victory over theſe, he ſays, <hi>It's of the Lord's mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi> He that had ſaid before, that his ſoul was removed far from peace, and he forgot proſperity, he finds proſperity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his deſpiſed and undervalued lots. It's not your continued croſſes, and long delays that is your affliction, it's your bitterneſs that is the poiſon and ſting of them all, and makes them ſo afflicting: It's with you as with that man <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord:</hi> When he hath perverted his way, he would blame God
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47356:139"/>
for his own unthrift. There is no outgate of a Croſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this, the coming off with a meek mind, as that word <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.18. holds out, <hi>He hath delivered my ſoul in peace from the battel that was againſt me.</hi> O! look to the peace of your mind under continued difficulties, let not that break. Ye know not what affliction means till ye get an imbittered mind, which will make a Mole-hill a Mountain, nay, will create a Croſs to it ſelf, yea is a Croſs in it ſelf, and can contrive a Croſs where there is none, even when a man is convinced his lot is good: Set him in a Paradiſe of pleaſure, his imbittered mind will make it a torment to him; therefore look on an imbittered mind as the greateſt ſting and poiſoner of all that can befall you, and guard againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may perſwade folks to ſtudy meekneſs and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, when they conſider what an imbittered fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition portends; what doth it import and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a man? I ſhall tell you, it portends mo and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rods to tame that wild and imbittered heart, to humble that fretful diſpoſition: a man who though he hing on, yet is fretful, cankard, bitter, all that he meets with in his lot, is the wormood and the gall to him; he is like a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh man, that hath ſomething in his ſtomach that muſt be purged, his taſte is marred, which makes that which is ſweet bitter; and though thou belong to God, yet (as it is ſaid of wicked men) if thou walk contrary unto him, he will walk contrary unto thee, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. And thou may expect ſeven times more yoke upon yoke, croſs upon croſs, till thou be tame, and ſubject thy ſelf to him. In a word, ſo long as a man is in a bitter frame, he evidences that the medicine God hath given him, hath never won to the root of his diſeaſe, and he may look for a harder potion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may perſwade to the ſtudy of meekneſs, and to ſet againſt bitterneſs, to conſider that bitterneſs is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47356:139"/>
               <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.9. <hi>Wo to him that ſtrives with his Maker, let the pot ſheards strive with the pot ſheards of the earth; ſhall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, what makeſt thou?</hi> He is the Lord, to whom, who can ſay, What doſt thou? Ponder that word which I have often occaſion to mind you of, <hi>Job</hi> 18.4. <hi>He teareth himſelf in his anger:</hi> (a lively and pathetick deſcription of a fretful diſpoſition, he would eat himſelf in his anger,) but <hi>ſhall the earth be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</hi> Is there no more ado but turn all the wheels of providence up-ſide down, when ye take the pett? When ſuch a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing as thou art not pleaſed with it, ſays <hi>Bildad</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> O fretful body, wilt thou ſit down and aſk, who ſhould guide the world? Who ſhould have the Throne? Whether God or thou? Whether ſhould he guide thee, or thou guide thy ſelf? Whether wilt thou yield to God, or have him yield to thee? Shall not God bruſk his Throne and Government, but thou like a Child of <hi>Belial</hi> envyeth it? Nay further, let me plead for God, bitter body, what ails thee? what would do thy turn? Thou can name ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things thou wants, and would have, but thou knows not where thy diſeaſe lyes, it is within thee that ails thee; let God cut thee ſhort of favours, or reſtore them to thee, put thee in trouble, or deliver thee, it will not cure thee, thou wilt never want a croſs, ſo long as that baſe luſt of bitterneſs abides in thee unſubdued; that which was a luſt in the enjoyment of favours, will turn a luſt in the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them; change thy caſe every day, it will not eaſe thee, thou art like a ſick man, that crys for drink, but it doth not ſlocken him, the cooling of his blood, and purging of his diſtemper muſt do that; therefore look on bitterneſs and fretfulneſs in your frame, as a moſt abſurd irrational thing.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe Conſideratious ſhould perſwade you to look on the excellency and advantage of waiting on God,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47356:140"/>
in oppoſition to making haſte, and to fretfulneſs ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; So I ſhall ſhut up both with a general Word, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing waiting, from the advantages that generally reſults from it, and I can give you no better thing to command it, than that of our Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.18. <hi>Bleſt are all they that wait on him;</hi> It is beyond all peradventure, that a waiting people on God, in difficult times, are a bleſt people; Their lot may ſeem accurſed; but their waiting on God proves, that the curſe is taken out of it, <hi>Bleſt is the man</hi> and woman that wearies not, that frets not under difficult lots, Why? becauſe they are at their duty; Thrice bleſt are they (as I may, if the Lord will, handle in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs) that love their duty for it ſelf with an eye to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation, whatever may be the iſſue of it. But I ſhall add three Evidences of Bleſſedneſs, that attends wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A waiter on God is bleſt, becauſe by waiting, he keeps more than trouble can take from him; ye have a very Emphatick word for this, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. <hi>In your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence poſſeſs ye your ſouls.</hi> Sharp Tryals long continued may diſpoſſeſs you of all other things, liberty, wealth, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or whatever is dear to you; but, ſays he, if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue patient, ye ſhall have this bleſſing, ye <hi>ſhall poſſeſs your ſelves;</hi> an impatient man is a ſort of mad-man, he is not at himſelf, he poſſeſſes not himſelf, becauſe that Time, or Inſtruments in Time, have done him a prejudice, he will do himſelf a worſe, becauſe they have taken this or that away from him, he will caſt a ſweet frame and mind away after it; and that is to do himſelf a worſe turn than the world can do to him; in ſo doing, he caſts more away than the World can take from him: So on that account, the waiter on God is bleſſed, even on that, becauſe of the ſweet frame he is keeped in; Caſt the waiter on God where you will, ſtill he will fall on his feet, and on that account, <hi>Bleſt are all they that wait on God:</hi> But again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bleſſed is the waiter on God, upon the account that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47356:140"/>
the through-bearing that attends waiting on God, will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, till he get a good iſſue: O! to ſee the deſperat ſhifts that impatient, fretful thoughts will put folk to in difficulties, they go like mad-men, as the Word is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.20. <hi>They are like wild bulls in a net, full of the fury of the Lord:</hi> O! how do they daſh themſelves on ſnares, and run themſelves on Rocks to their ruine: The foul ſlips of fretful bodies are many; &amp; though they be dear to God, that temper will bring them halting home: But would ye ſee the Bleſſedneſs of the waiter on God, read at your leiſure, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.29. <hi>He gives power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength;</hi> He deſires none of your furniture to ſerve him with, in a waiting poſture; and, (in the by) if ye think ye have much furniture, he will empty you, and ye muſt be in a fainting poſture, ere he give power, and be having no might, ere he increaſe ſtrength; and then, even <hi>the youths (Bahurim</hi> ſelected ones) <hi>ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall utterly fail: but they that wait on the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not be faint;</hi> one would think, yoke youths with the faint, and them that have no might, it were eaſie to determine who would carry the Prize; But here the faint, the feckleſs waiting on God carry it when the youths are laid by. How many a great Spirit hath Tryals broken? When thou art a weak feeble body, and yet has keeped up thine heart and held on the way; How many a gallant have got a daſh? when thou a craſy crau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling creature are kept to the fore, and made to renew thy ſtrength through waiting on God.</p>
            <p>And 3. (Reverencing Providence that I have been detained on this Subject,) They are neceſſarly bleſſed who are <hi>waiters on God,</hi> on the account of the out-gate: The <hi>waiter on God</hi> ſhall have an out-gate from all his difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. Ye have heard of the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47356:141"/>
pitiful and of tender Mercy; I dare aſſure you, that Song abides <hi>waiters on God,</hi> which ye have <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.9. <hi>It ſhall be ſaid in that day, Lo, this is our God, and we have waited for him, and he will ſave us; This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his ſalvation;</hi> It is not a God wrapped up in a Promiſe, it is not a God covered with a cloud, of whom the World ſaid, <hi>Where is their God? Mic.</hi> 7.10. But, <hi>lo, there he is whom we waited for;</hi> and the additional word is, <hi>We will be glad and rejoice in his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> It ſhall be ſeen and ſaid then, <hi>Bleſt are they that wait for the Lord;</hi> Canſt thou not then wait and watch for one hour? when thou knoweſt not but in the hour that thou gives over, he may come; Therefore wait on the account of the bleſſed out-gate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1. <hi>I waited patiently on the Lord, and he inclined his ear unto me, and heard my cry; he brought me alſo out of a horrible pit, and miry clay, and ſet my foot on a rock, and eſtabliſht my goings; and he hath put a new ſong in my mouth, even praiſe unto our God;</hi> A new Song is the reſult of <hi>waiting on God;</hi> Believers and the Church may hing their harps on the Willows, and they may weep, when they remember Zion, and ſay, <hi>How can we ſing the Lord's ſong in a ſtrange Land? Pſal.</hi> 137. But a new Song in Gods good time, ſhall be put in the mouths of all that are <hi>waiters on God:</hi> And if I might inſiſt to add a word fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would lead you to uncipher that Text, I cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you.</hi> I ſhall not determine the ſcope of the place; but the time comes when his waiting ſhall be ſeen to be gracious; that <hi>waiters on him</hi> ſhall be convinced, he took the fitteſt opportunity to manifeſt himſelf gracious; and if ſuch had come ſooner, there ſhould no ſuch Grace have been ſeen in it; Fleſh under difficulties thinks that he waits to be cruel; but look again, and thou will find, he waits to be gracious; and not only ſo, but he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on his on-waiters, he will make it out, that if he be an exalted God, he will be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47356:141"/>
a merciful God; and ſo, as his people that wait on him, ſhall acknowledge him to be an exalted God in that, and ſhall ſing, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders;</hi> And whereas thou may think, there is little regard to be had to thy fighting, pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling life, in <hi>waiting on him;</hi> he will make it out, that he is a God of Judgment, pondering their condition he hath to do with; as Phyſitians conſider the condition of their Patients, and weigh their Doſes conform, and will not add a grain more than what is needful; ſo will he deal with them that wait on him, he will be ſeen to be a God of Judgment, and therefore, bleſſed are they that wait on him, and bleſt ſhall ye be, if ye believe theſe things, and if ye make it your exerciſe to let your patience be ſeen in your meek waiting for him, for there ſhall be a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe things which are told you from the Lord. I ſhall inſiſt no further. <hi>The Lord bleſs his word to you for Chriſt's ſake.</hi>

            <p>I Am now broken in a little upon this third part of the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> wreſtling and exerciſe, how that after his imploying of God by Prayer, under trouble, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a right method for purging away of the guilt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; he is exerciſed with delays, and protracting, to his ſenſe, of delivery and comfort, which he wreſtles with, by confident, affectionat, and patient waiting on God: Having ſpoken ſomewhat to the general Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance and Conſtancy, and broken in the laſt day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſpoken to the firſt Head of theſe Words, the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's</hi> exerciſe, he was <hi>waiting:</hi> I ſpoke to theſe two firſt Heads of Doctrine: 1. That which was ſupponed here,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47356:142"/>
That the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was put to wait; and ſhew that God may, and often doth exerciſe his people, when they are walking tenderly with delays. And 2. I ſpoke to that which is proponed, that when he is put to wait, he doth wait; under theſe delays, waiting for other things, from God according to his word, than the preſent Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did promiſe; he waited, he proved, he did believe, without making haſte, and he waited without bitterneſs, fretfulneſs, paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe two, I took ſome time the laſt day to preſs on you, as needful Leſſons; that when God exerciſes you with delays, and ſuſpends the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Promiſes, ye ſhould wait for God, believing his Word, not making haſte, with meekneſs and calmneſs of Spirit.</p>
            <p>I propoſed a ſecond thing to be ſpoken to in the Words, to which I proceed, and that is the Object of his exerciſe, <hi>I wait,</hi> for what? <hi>for the Lord,</hi> ſays he, that was the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his waiting, whether he was waiting for Comfort againſt deſertion, or for delivery out of trouble, or for both; he is waiting for the Lord, and this if we ſhall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out a little, will give ſome mo things to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in a man, that is truly a waiter for God; and what I would ſay on it, I ſhall briefly reduce to theſe three, which I conceive imported in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A waiter on God hath his Eyes taken off all other things, and ſet on God only, for what he wants, and would have, That is one thing imported in it; not only is a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on God taken off ſinful ſhifts, that will diſappoint all that uſe them, as it is ſaid, when the Lord ſhould ſmite <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the people of that Iſle or Countrey ſhould be aſhamed of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> their Expectation, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> their Glory; and they ſhall ſay in that day, <hi>Behold, ſuch is our expectation, whither ſhall we flee for help? to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the king of Aſsyria, and how ſhall we eſcape? Iſa.</hi> 20.5. Now there our expectation is blown up: And, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Truly in vain is ſalvation looked for from the hills, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47356:142"/>
from the multitude of mountains.</hi> That is all the poor ſhifts they had betaken themſelves to, they ſhall be fruſtrat as to their expectation of help from them; But I ſay, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are waiters on God taken off ſinful ſhifts, but have what they will to eye; this is the Character of a waiting man, that his eyes are taken off all things, and ſet on God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5. <hi>My ſoul, wait thou only on God, for my expectation is from him:</hi> And ye have the poſture of them whom God will notice, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I will leave in the midſt of thee, an afflicted and poor people, and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord:</hi> They are a people emptied of all expectation from any other art, but <hi>truſting in God;</hi> they are left on him, and betake themſelves to him alone.</p>
            <p>Now the Saints that are waiters on God, indeed are put to this ſhift of waiting on God, on divers accounts, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all other ſhifts may, and often do miſgive upon their hand, not only ſinful ſhifts, but all other, diſappointment on diſappointment, from one thing to another, may be the lot of them that are put to this exerciſe of waiting on God; it was not enough for <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> perſecute him, that the <hi>Ziphits</hi> were ready to betray him, and that near relations, Father and Mother ſhould forſake him, as he hints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10. but he muſt be put to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4. <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld but there was no man that would owne me; refuge failed me; There was no man that cared for my ſoul;</hi> when he is ſhut up in the Cave, all his men that were about him, ſlight him, think him an unhappy man, and themſelves unhappy in following him: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.1.— <hi>If the Lord had not been on our ſide when men roſe up againſt us, They had ſwallowed us up quick,</hi> &amp;c. There the people of God are left on him alone: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.17. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs the Lord had been my help, my ſoul had almoſt,</hi> or (as it is on the margine) quickly dwelt in ſilence; There was nothing betwixt me and utter off-cutting, but God's ſtepping in to be my help: From this in the by, ye may take this with you, that the waiting
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47356:143"/>
people of God are never tryed enough, till all things fail them but God, till they be ſtripped naked of all things they expected help from, and they left on God alone; and whatever be God's condeſcendency to their weakneſs, in giving them means of help at any time, they would lay their account to be brought that low, as to have none to look to for help but God only. 2. The ſaints have their eyes only on God in their waiting, becauſe when they are ſtript of all other things that promiſed help; They ſee there is ground enough to wait on God for all that; They look not on the blaſting of all their expectations as a <hi>nolumus</hi> on the back of their Bill; or as inviting them to ſay there is no help: They will wait on God, when nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them to it, and why? I ſhall offer to you a threefold account, on which ſaints afflicted, emptied, and ſtripped of all things without God, do not give over waiting on God. 1. This is one, they ſee God all-ſufficient to do their turn, not only without the help of ſecond Means; but when ſeemingly they combine to oppoſe what they would be at; they wait for Jehovah, and ſee their delivery or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort not to be further off, that there be nothing viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing it; yea when all viſible means and cauſes threaten the contrary, why? Their King is Jehovah, who can command deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44 4. <hi>Thou art my King, O God, command deliverance for Jacob;</hi> A word from him can bring deliverance, though there were no promiſing evidence of it, but rather the contrary. 2. Another is, ſaints when ſtript and emptied of all things, do not give over waiting on God, becauſe he is not only able, if he will, to do their turn, when all refuge fails them, but his owning his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in difficulties, is a ſpecial part of his glory, <hi>which he will not give to any other;</hi> little do we underſtand the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of Divine Providence, little know we wherefore he blaſts probabilities, and defeats all the expectations of his people; but whatever elſe be in it, it is for this chiefly, that Himſelf may be ſeen to be their Deliverer, and none
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47356:143"/>
other; Therefore he does with them, as he did with <hi>Gideon</hi>'s army, when he brought them to three hundred, and with theſe three hundred, with Trumpets and lamps in pitchers, defeat the <hi>Midianites, Judges</hi> 7. That their Delivery might be ſeen of him; And if this were well ſeen, it would give the people of God a comfortable look of God's laying by all ſecond Cauſes, ſtripping them naked of all helps, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Diſpenſations threaten ruine; they would ſay, our Maſters feet are behind theſe, this is but a dark hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dawning. So doth <hi>David</hi> reaſon in that forecited Pſalm, 142.4, 5. <hi>When he looked on the right and left hand, and there was no man that would know him, refuge failed him, no man cared for his ſoul;</hi> What follows? <hi>I cryed unto thee, O Lord; I ſaid, thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living;</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.18. <hi>When I ſaid my foot ſlips, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up;</hi> When there was nothing betwixt him and ruine, but Gods Mercy, he found that a preſent help. But, 3. The Children of God when ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all things but God, have ground to wait on God, and do wait on him, not only becauſe he is able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and delights to lay by other things, that he may be ſeen in their delivery, but whereas guilt is a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, and ſtares the waiter on God in the face, that he knows not how to expect good from God, till that be removed, and taken out of the way; yet he waits on God, on this account, that there is <hi>hope in Iſrael concerning that thing;</hi> that his guilt ſhall be no impediment to his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or any good thing he wants, and is needful for him, if he do with it, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth here, <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 4. If he take with it, be humbled for it, lay claim to pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy in the right method, he may notwithſtanding ſay, <hi>I wait for the Lord:</hi> There are two notable grounds of encouragement, which as they would not be abuſed, ſo being rightly improven, are very uſeful to waiters on God; One is, that right taking with guilt, and repentance for it, after much incorrigibleneſs, is attainable, when we
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47356:144"/>
have called our ſelves, for any thing we can ſee in our ſelves, or expect from means, reprobat ſilver; yet the Lord can humble and tame that uncircumciſed heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.19. He can turn <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who has reſiſted many means, and hath <hi>been as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke:</hi> Another is that which I am upon, guilt taken with and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, needs not hinder a man to wait on God. Theſe places that I cited the laſt day proves it, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord, that hides his face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him:</hi> Though he be a God that is provocked to withdraw, and hide his face, yet I will wait on him, &amp; look for him: And <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7, 8. When the Church is low, yet ſhe <hi>will look to the Lord, and will wait for him, and wait for the God of his ſalvation;</hi> believing, her God will hear her; and on that ground, bids the enemy boaſt at leiſure; She anſwers that Objection concerning guilt, that ſhe will bear the indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath ſinned, ſhe will take with guilt, and ſtoop to his correcting hand, till he plead her cauſe, and execute Judgment for her; ſhe looks over the mountain of her guilt, when ſhe hath taken with it, and waits for the Lord. So ye ſee what is firſt imported in this waiting for God, that the eyes of the waiting man muſt be taken off all things, and ſet on God only; and that theſe who would wait on God, would lay their account to be more and more ſtript of all things, till they be left on God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, they have good ground to wait on God; and the waiter on God taking with guilt, and pleading for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may in that humble poſture wait ſtill for God.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the ſecond thing imported in this waiting on God, and that is, The waiting man left on God, and ſeeing an all-ſufficiency in God to do his turn, in the faith of that, he ſo waits for God; That is to wait for the Lord, when the confidence of Gods help, encourages the waiting man, in waiting on God, to ſtick cloſs by the way of God, that he will not have a comfort but in his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47356:144"/>
way, he will not have a delivery, but that which comes with Divine approbation; He will not purchaſe a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Out-gate with the price of the leaſt ſin, Why? he waits for God in his way: Troubles and delays are a great temptation to ſhake off tenderneſs, the preſſure, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the leaſt of troubles are ill counſellors in a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture, they will bid run to the leeſt, row to the beſt ſhore, take any courſe for an out-gate: But he who is a waiter on God, indeed his tenderneſs grows, as his trouble grows, and as his delays are protracted, he ſtudies to be the more tender. I ſhall not inſiſt on this; but 1. It is certain, a waiter for God ſhould be, and in ſo far as he waits rightly on God, he is, and will be a tender man, as the Word is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.34. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way;</hi> a waiter on God hath his Ears nailed to the Poſts of Divine Direction, ſo that neither to the right nor left hand dare he move, but as he hath a warrand from God; So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. There were folks that were <hi>tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> mark it, they were not tortured, becauſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was not granted, but becauſe deliverance could not be accepted on ſinful Terms, when offered: The greatneſs of their trouble did not diminiſh their tenderneſs, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it did augment it; if at any time they found tenderneſs neceſſary, they found it eſpecially when their trouble was great.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ye ſhall mark, that as true waiting requires tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo tenderneſs is attainable; that is, through Grace it is attainable, That a Saint waiting on God in his way, in a tender frame, may attain to go through difficulties without ſinning againſt God; It is true, temptations to ſin will go thick and threefold, when a Saint is put to wait for God in continued troubles, and meets with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, delays, difficulties and preſſures, which (as I ſaid before) are woful counſellors in a ſad day, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf; But yet notwithſtanding,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47356:145"/>
tenderneſs is attainable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 13. God hath laid his Faithfulneſs in pawn for it, that he will not ſuffer the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walker <hi>to be tempted above what they are able, but will with the temptation make a way to eſcape,</hi> that they may be able to bear it. There is another word more nearly relates to what I am upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not always reſt on the lot of the righteous, leſt they put forth their hands to iniquity;</hi> That is, God ſhall neither let it ly ſo long, nor ſo ſore on his people, as it may drive them to commit iniquity, if they be willing to keep their feet, and walk tenderly; Therefore (as I may have occaſion afterward to preſs) let none plead the impoſſibility of riding out a ſtorm, let them never plead the greatneſs of a temptation and the continuance of trouble, as an excuſe for an unten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walk; ſeing tenderneſs is attainable in waiting on God for an out-gate; God lets not the rod of the wicked laſt on the lot of the righteous, ſo as it may be ground of temptation, rationally to prevail with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt Word I ſhall ſay on this ſhall be. That as the right waiter on God is tender, and tenderneſs in the greateſt difficulties is attainable; ſo the want of tenderneſs in difficulties, when folks loſes, or gives up tenderneſs, and their feet ſlides; O what a ſad after-game will that make! When <hi>David</hi> in his ſtrait had played the fool changed his behaviour before the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.11. He got ſuch a bitter fill of his folly in that, that he gives his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11.—<hi>Come ye Children, hearken to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord; what man is he that deſires life, and loveth many days, that he may ſee good, keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from ſpeaking guile, depart from evil, and do good, ſeek peace, and purſue it.</hi> He ſets up his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bording as a beacon, &amp; turns a Preacher to all others, that would ſee the Lords end, that they walk tenderly: And ye know what a length the holy man did run, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beholding the proſperity of the wicked, he was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to caſt out with Godlineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. and what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47356:145"/>
upon it, when he came to himſelf, <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22. <hi>My heart was grieved, I was pricked in my reins, ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a beaſt before thee;</hi> he looks on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as not being a rational man, but as a beaſt before God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> may not inſiſt upon this, but there are three ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, that reſults on untenderneſs in difficulties, while we ſhould be waiting on God in his way. 1. It forſlows the mans delivery and out-gate, which tenderneſs would haſten; folk are ready to think that the taking of a ſinful courſe, is the way to haſten an out-gate; but an unten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walk, the uſing of any ſinful ſhift, to be out of trouble is like the <hi>Nazarites</hi> pollution, he loſt all the days that went before, becauſe his ſeparation was defiled, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.12. And he was to begin again: Untenderneſs may ſend the people of God from <hi>Kadeſhbarnea</hi> back to the Red-ſea, to wander for thirty eight years in the Wilderneſs; never think that untenderneſs will bring eaſe, or an happy iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of trouble; folk thereby may take an out-gate, or delivery at their hand, but it will prolong a lifetime of trouble. 2. Another ſad Conſequence of untenderneſs, it not only foreſlows the delivery, but it makes the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed trouble very dreadful; trouble and guilt, trouble and an ill-conſcience will make a moſt ſad lot in a ſad time. It is a great deal better for folk to ſubmit to Providence, to ſtudy tenderneſs, than to eaſe themſelves of a Croſs, by wandring our of the way of God. A 3d. ſad conſequence of untenderneſs is, the ſad reflection it may give of God, when he comes to deliver his people, when the tender waiter on God ſays, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> untender walkers muſt ſay, we waited not for him, we would not wait, but took a ſinful ſhift to ſave our ſelves, and ſo is ſeen on it: So much for the 2d. thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in waiting for God; That it is ſuch a waiting, as makes the waiter keep the way of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:47356:146"/>I ſhall add a 3d. thing imported in this waiting for God, <hi>I wait for the Lord;</hi> It doth not only import, that the waiting man hath his eyes taken off all other things, and ſet on God, and that he is tender in his walk, and keeps Gods way in his waiting for God, but that God himſelf, and the enjoyment of him, is the great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the man that truly waits for him; a man that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waits for God, hath not only his eyes taken off other things, and ſet on God, but God himſelf is the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that which chiefly he miſſes, and would have; not only will he long to have God in his favour and love, with all that he gets, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thy preſence go not with us, carry us not hence, Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>And theſe things will I do to them, and not forſake them, Iſai.</hi> 42.16. But he longs to have God in ſtead of all he wants, and hath the want of all made up in the enjoyment of him: This is a point that ye would preſs more upon your ſelves, as the bleſt Fruit of all ſad Diſpenſations, and long continued Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ye have been, are, or may be under, for which ye have abundant warrand from Scripture; not only when all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge fails you, would ye make it your ſtudy to walk ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, to be always found in God's way, in waiting for him; but this would be a bleſt Fruit of ſuch ſad Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, to have your deſires ſpiritual, centred on God, drawn forth for him, and the ſhutting of all doors, looked on as a call to come and reſt on him, and take him for all ye want, and would have. This were a mean to further our expectations as to other things, and to make up the want of them for the preſent, ſo as the want of them ſhould be no want, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.7. <hi>And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee:</hi> What's this I am waiting for, I have a nearer cut to the enjoyment of all things in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thee. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and that</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. It is <hi>David</hi>'s One thing. <hi>One thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Were folk Spiritual, and finding an
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47356:146"/>
up-making in God of all their deſires and expectations, it were a ſhort cut to an eaſe of all their grievances, and it is a great lengthner of all the afflictions of the people of God, that they do not forget proſperity, and learn to have their deſires ſpiritual, and to make up the want of all things in God; if they were ſpiritual in their deſires, whatever their difficulties were, it would be all a matter to them, if they got more of God, if all their difficulties and wants did run in this channel, to purſue for more of God, to have him not to be their terror, but their hope in an evil day: Though they ſhould want the Ordinances, he ſhould be a ſanctuary to them; Though men ſhould curſe, What then? It is all a matter if he bleſs; Though they ſhould be counted the off-ſcourings of all things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, reproached, no matter if their names be written in Heaven: O ſpiritual deſires, would not only further an iſſue, but be a preſent iſſue in all difficulties; but hardly are the children of men out of one of three ſnares, either they are mad on their Idols, while they have them, or they are mad for the loſs of them, when they want them, or when they are reſtored to them, they ſurfeit on them, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did on fleſh in the Wilderneſs; Therefore while their deſires are not ſpiritual, carried forth on God and heavenly things, to make up the want of things earthly; It's no wonder their delivery be foreſlowed of theſe things, and will be forſlovved till they cleanſe their deſires of vvhat they are ſo much vvedded to, and cauſe lamenting over their buried Idols, knovving it vvill be a plague to them to have them reſtored.</p>

            <p>AS in handling the former tvvo Verſes, I had a great Goſpel Truth and Priviledge among my hands; ſo
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47356:147"/>
in the fifth &amp; ſixth Verſes, there is a lively deſcription of a great and concerning Goſpel-duty, patient, affectionat, and confident waiting for God; The Duty, that is a great Characteriſtick of a godly man, vvho hath a Well vvithin him, that neither Summers heat, nor Winters froſt can dry up; but as it is <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8. <hi>In ſummer and winter ſhall it be there;</hi> and vvho muſt prove this by his being well breathed to vvait on God, vvhen his Promiſes and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſeem to claſh one vvith another, vvhen his Word gives one report of him, and his diſpenſations a quit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair; When His Word calls him <hi>The hearer of Prayer,</hi> and His Diſpenſations ſay, <hi>That prayer is ſhut out, and his anger ſmoaks againſt the prayers of his people.</hi> When his vvord ſays, <hi>he that hath promiſed to come, will come, and will not tarry;</hi> and his diſpenſations ſay not only, that he tarrieth, but that he vvill never come. Here is the vvell breathed Grace of Patience, affectionat, and confident expectation, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to vvait on, and not to make haſte, and to be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meek in vvaiting on.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken to tvvo Heads here from the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> exerciſe, he <hi>is waiting;</hi> and the Object of his vvaiting, he is <hi>waiting for the Lord;</hi> his eyes are taken off all other things and ſet on God, for vvhat he vvould be at; and in the faith of that he vvaits on God, and keeps his vvay; and vvhen any thing of that kind is not accompliſhed to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſenſe, <hi>he waits for the Lord,</hi> that more enjoyment of him may make up the vvant of theſe things. Sad Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations ſpiritualize his deſires; It is not any good that vvill ſatisfie him; but it is one thing, <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord,</hi> to have the communion of God, and to have the light of his Countenance.</p>
            <p>Novv I proceed to the third thing in the Words, That is, his affection in vvaiting; vvaiting is his exerciſe, the Object of it is the Lord; The manner of his vvaiting is affectionat, <hi>my ſoul doth wait;</hi> I do vvait affectionatly, and what the meaſure of his affection in vvaiting is, he reſumes,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47356:147"/>
               <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>My ſoul writs for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning:</hi> I ſhall here ſpeak to tvvo Obſervations, and for the ground of the firſt, Mark, That the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> vvhile he profeſſes to vvait, he declares that he ſets himſelf againſt all haſte, paſſion and fretfulneſs, about vvhat he vvaited; in oppoſition to theſe, he <hi>waits for God:</hi> But now he finds it neceſſary to guard againſt another extream; it might be ſaid, ye wait, and are not fretted with delays, and why? ye are indifferent for what ye wait for, it is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent for you whether ye get or want it; and therefore ye may wait inconcernedly, without wearying: No, ſays he, though I do wait, my affection is not aſleep in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>my ſoul doth wait;</hi> I have affection to that which I want, yet I labour to have it, I have a waiting affection to it, with a ſubmiſſive affection in waiting for it.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerve, 1. That as patient waiting for God, is oppoſit to paſſion, fretfulneſs, bitterneſs and carnalneſs on the one hand; ſo on the other, it is oppoſite to dulneſs, ſtupidity and careleſneſs about what we want: Here the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> profeſſeth himſelf both a waiter, that is not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, nor cankered, and yet he is a ſoul-waiter, with his affection aloft for what he waits for. This particular may lead me to take notice of a General to be obſerved in the way of God's people; That is, that a mixed condition is their beſt condition; for here ye have a frame made up of Patience and Affection, affection running out for that it would be at, and patience clogging its wings, that it run not out of breath: We are full of Byaſſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to run on extreams without this mixture; if a man have affection, it is ready to pick quarrels at delays, if he have ſomewhat of patience, that patience is ready to fall aſleep, but theſe two make up a ſweet frame. I might here take notice of theſe advantages, or advantageous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both in the frame of the Saints, and in their lots; in their lots take them ſucceſſively, we will find odd mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in them, a rapture to Heaven, and a Meſſenger of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47356:148"/>
Satan ſent to buffet them on the back of it. It was needful that that eminent ſervant of God in his exaltation, ſhould be keeped with arms of ſuch a meſſenger; and beſide theſe ſucceſſive mixtures, we will find few lots of the ſaints, but a mixture may be obſerved in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.17. <hi>I am poor and needy, yet thought upon by God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>When weak, yet ſtrong. Iſai.</hi> 40.31. <hi>When faint, yet made to run and not be weary, and to walk and not be faint;</hi> when laid-by men, yet made-up men; their foot ſlipping, yet Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy holding them up. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.18. <hi>Troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſsed; perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; cast down, but not deſtroyed.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>As unknown, yet well known; as dying, yet living; as chastned, and not killed; as ſorrowful, yet always rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet poſseſſing all things;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. Theſe are ſeaſonable mixtures, ſweet reſerves, and exceptions in the lots of ſaints: And as there are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their lots, ſo in their frames, wherein we will find confidence ſeaſoned with deep humility; as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>I have taken upon me to ſpeak to the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> Gloriation ſeaſoned with the ſenſe of being nothing: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>In nothing am I behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, though I be nothing.</hi> Nearneſs to God ſeaſoned with a ſight of their own pollution. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Wo is me, I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſts. Job</hi> 42.5. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhore my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Thus ye ſee what a ſweet mixture, the frame and way of the ſaints is made up of, when right; and this in the Text is to be adverted, That patience in our waiting be ſeaſoned with affection, leſt our waiting turn to indifferency. There are many pretend to be waiters, but what wait they for? Their heart is not affected with it. Affection muſt ſtill be keeped on foot, and meek and patient muſt our waiting for God be? Therefore look to it. Let not folk deceive
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47356:148"/>
themſelves, in thinking that they have this patience and waiting, that I have been ſpeaking of, when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a coldrife indifferency, ſtupidity, loitering and lying by in that waiting. What Mercies do folk want, but they pretend to wait for them from God, and yet their Conſcience will bear them witneſs, their heart was never affected with the want of them, nor drawn forth after the enjoying of them; they cannot ſay, <hi>Their ſoul doth wait:</hi> As upon the one hand, true patience muſt temper the edge of right affection, that it over-reach not, or run it ſelf out of breath: So on the other hand it would be adverted, that while patience is tempering affection; affection be not feeding on the breaſts of ſecurity, careleſneſs, indifferency, ſtupidity, that with theſe Virgines, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. While they are waiting for the coming of the Lord, they do not fall aſleep, or ſlumbering, that's an abuſe of patience in waiting, when it is ſuffered to degenerat in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and indifferency. In a word, that ye may know what is meant by the Saints <hi>ſoul-waiting for God,</hi> I ſhall give it to you in what is repreſented in the people of God in the Captivity; upon the one hand we find a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is ſent unto them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.5 <hi>To build houſes in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and dwell in them, to plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them, take wives, and beget ſons and daughters, that they might be increaſed, and not diminiſhed, and to ſeek the good of the place, whither they were carried captives, and pray for the peace thereof;</hi> that is, that they ſhould be as careful as they might without ſin, to make their captivity tollerable, that was to wait for God, when their cankered haſte and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs was done away: And yet on the other hand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.1. <hi>By the rivers of Babel we ſat down, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we wept when we remembred Sion, we hanged our harps on the willows in the midſt thereof,</hi> when they requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us mirth, we ſaid, <hi>how ſhall we ſing the Lords ſong in a ſtrange land, if I forget thee, O Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. A ſoul-waiting affection is aloft in them, although they made
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47356:149"/>
their diſtreſſes as tolerable as they might without ſin, and were warranded ſo to do; yet they would not ſuffer their patience to degener in indifferency; they would not ſuffer their affection to fall aſleep, and forget that which their Captivity had deprived them of; and therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in difficulties, waiting for God, they would ſtill have ſomthing of that frame, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Jeruſalem remembred in the day of her affliction, and of her miſeries, all her pleaſant things, that ſhe had in the days of old, before the people fell into the hand of the enemy;</hi> Wait for God, there is good reaſon for it. Be patient and meek, Why not? But O! in your waiting, let it be ſeen that affection is aloft, when thou art ready bitterly to reſent God's depriving thee of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or detaining them from thee, guard againſt that; let bitterneſs be baniſht; but guard alſo againſt ſtupidity and ſenſeleſneſs, that they come not in the room of it, but let thy ſoul be waiting.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to a 2d. Obſervation from this Head, and that is a general, which I deferred to ſpeak to, when the laſt day I ſpoke to this <hi>waiting;</hi> and it now comes in ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> not only gives an account what he is doing, but how he is doing; Though he be delayed, and mercies be keeped back, yet he dare avow he is waiting for the Lord; yea, that his waiting for God is of the right ſtamp, that his ſoul is waiting; that in his waiting he keeps off both the extreams of paſſion and haſte, and of careleſs ſtupidity and indifferency: The Obſervation then is, that it is not only a commendable thing in Saints, to be able to give an account of what they are doing, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſad times, but it is comfortable to themſelves, when they are able to give an account of what they are doing, and that they are in the way of their duty, it is ſo to the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here, that he can ſay, <hi>he waits, and his ſoul waits for God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Point I ſhall ſpeak to in theſe four, becauſe it is, and will be your work if ye be ſerious.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:47356:149"/>
               <item>1. That work is our great buſineſs.</item>
               <item>2. That work acceptable to God in a low condition, is attainable.</item>
               <item>3. That as it is attainable, ſo a man may know he hath attained it.</item>

            </list>
            <p>A little to theſe four, as time will permit.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I ſay, work and duty is our main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when our lots are ſaddeſt: One would think it had been a more ſeaſonable, and a more near concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Queſtion for the Pſalmiſt, to be now looking what God is doing, when he had been crying out of the deeps, taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ith guilt, pleading for pardon, but he looks to what he himſelf is doing; we would alway, as I hinted before, fain be at the Throne, and have the guiding of the world, or have God taking our advice what he ſhould do in it; and how much of folks time and ſpirit, who are ſerious, is taken up in ſcanning of providence? but O! fix this, that duty is ours, event is Gods; duty is our taſk, and we ſhould leave it to God, to make of us and duty what pleaſes him: yea more, it is one of the great ends, why ſad times and lots paſſes over us, that we may give a proof what we think of duty, when it wants preſent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; whether we will take duty for a reward to it ſelf; whether a man will bleſs God, go the world as it will, that he is at duty. I ſhall ſay no more of it, but thrice happy they, who eſteem of duty abſtract from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable events: yea more, it were a good prognoſtick that good events would not be long withholden, if folk were diligent at duty, but who are ſtill poring on events, I may without breach of charity ſay, that theſe are the idleſt folk, and foreſlow their own mercy.</p>
            <p>But 2. As duty is the great buſineſs, ſo duty acceptable to God is attainable in the worſt of times, in the loweſt of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47356:150"/>
conditions. I need not ſtand on the general, how it's Gods mercy to his people, that they may well be deprived of comforts, or comfortable iſſues, but they are not put out of ſervice, they can never want acceptable work to put their hand unto, and if they be turned idle from the work of their Calling and Station, their idleneſs is a work with ſubmiſſion to God. But that which I am upon is, that the difficulties of the Lords ſervants and people, are never ſo great, but duty acceptable to God is attainable; <hi>My ſoul waits,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) he wan at it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, times and diſpenſations may ſoon fall forth to be ſuch, that hypocrites will think duty to be impoſſible, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the hypocrites,</hi> they are afraid out of their wits; <hi>Who ſhall dwell with devouring fire?</hi> &amp;c. Who can hold their feet? Who can ſtick by duty in ſuch critical diſpenſations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. I confeſs alſo, things may come to that, that <hi>Balaam</hi> hath, ſpeaking of the calamities to come on the world, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.23. <hi>Alas, who ſhall live when God doth this?</hi> Such a time may come, that it may be a wonder to conſider how folk can ſtand, how they can fend, when ſtorms are ſo boiſterous and thick, and temptations and ſnares ſo many: And I ſhall add further, that which our Lord hath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.22. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs theſe days ſhould be ſhortned, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved;</hi> he means, both that none ſhould be ſaved from cutting off by judgment, and none but they ſhould be in peril to be eternally loſt by ſeduction, but for the elects ſake theſe days ſhall be ſhortned; outward trouble, and ſeducing ſnares, may be ſo many and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that if God put not ſome Bridle upon them, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved: But yet when I have ſaid all this, I muſt reſume the point, that in the worſt of times, duty acceptable to God is attainable through his ſtrength. A ſincere man depending on God, may win to ſay, <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait.</hi> This I mark to give a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47356:150"/>
check partly to the diſcouragements of Gods own people, who in ſad times loſe heart and hand. I confeſs, I may ſay to the diſcouragement of this generation, that which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> hath, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 12.5.) <hi>If thou haſt run with foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and they have wearied thee, how then canſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with horſes? and if in the land of peace wherein thou truſtedſt, they wearied thee, how then wilt thou do in the ſwellings of Jordan?</hi> If any ordinary difficulties ſcarr this generation from duty, what would they have done if they had met with the difficulties that many before the Throne met with? But be as it will, it's thy great ſin, as diſcouraged to ly down and die, as if there were no work for thee. The Pſalmiſt here in his practice hath witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that in the ſaddeſt of difficulties duty acceptable to God is attainable, if duty be ſet about in Gods ſtrength; though humbling it may prove, it ſhall not be impoſſible, if thou believe, all things ſhall be poſſible; partly to leave a ſad check at their door, who upon difficulties, and the impetuouſneſs of ſnares and temptations, take a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themſelves to go wrong, to leave Gods way, and joyn in evil courſes. How many are there that in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and ſnaring times, for all that the Bible hath ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch and ſuch ſins, and ſinful courſes, yet take them by the end, and ſay there is no hope, and it's for no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for men to eſſay to keep their integrity, or think to hold off, and not imbrace ſuch a courſe. The ſtorm blows ſo hard, but you that take a diſpenſation to your ſelves, ſo to do in difficulties, know that there will be witneſſes found to teſtify againſt you, that in the worſt of times duty acceptable to God is attainable.</p>
            <p>But the 3d thing I propoſed to be ſpoken to is, That as duty is attainable, ſo a man may know he hath attained it, he may win not only to wait for the Lord, and with his ſoul to wait, but to know and avow it, that with his
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47356:151"/>
ſoul he doth wait: This, if I might inſiſt on it, would again branch it ſelf out in two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In order to this knowledge, it is neceſſary, that folk be at ſelf examination, aſking what they are doing? Ye may take many woful counſels with your ſelves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſorrow in your heart daily, (it may be) and yet not come ſpeed; but were ye enquiring, What work am I at? and examining it, that were a ground of a right walk, to be ſerious in that. It's the Lords complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>No man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turneth unto his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 2. When we ſet about this Examination, we ſhould know, that we have need of the ſpirit of God to go along with us, and aſſiſt us in it, we have need of <hi>that spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. We have ſo much preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſecurity on the one hand, when we are at eaſe, ready to cheat us, and on the other hand, when we are in trouble, ſo much diſcouragement to amaze and break us, that in both conditions ſelf-examination would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a manuduction, a leading by the hand by the Spirit of God, that they get not a back-ſet in either.</p>
            <p>And 3. Tender walkers examining, and aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, may come to know they are in duty accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and their integrity in it, to ſay, their ſoul waiteth, I am at my duty, and am acceptable to God in it. It may be ſad, that trouble ſhould diſcover ſo much guilt, and ſo many imperfections in our beſt things, yet ſtill no diſpenſation of providence, or delay, ſhould take away the teſtimony of our integrity, and that we are wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him in his way; what-ever providence be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to, it is never an enemy to integrity. There is a weakneſs hinted at in that word, <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 69.4. (though few be obnoxious to it) <hi>Then I restored that which I took
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47356:151"/>
not away:</hi> Some may be ready to father that on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereof they are not guilty; but the people of God <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17.— hold faſt and avow their integrity in a ſad time: <hi>All this is come upon us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Job</hi> 23.10.— when he cannot get a ſight of God on the right or left hand, yet (ſaith he) <hi>He knows the way that I take: when he trys me, I ſhall come forth like gold,</hi> &amp;c. What I would ſay from this, is to leave a check at their door, whom the diſpenſations of providence dings from all their confidence; if God delay the Pſalmiſt, he will avow that he waits; but ſo ſilly are we, that there is nothing the ſtorm blows againſt, but we are ready to queſtion it; whereas if we ſee it be fair before the wind, we queſtion it not at all, ſo ſilly ſpirits are we, and ſo full of byaſſes. O! lament this, and know that duty is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and avowable in the ſaddeſt of diſpenſations, for the Pſalmiſt can ſay, <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 4. As duty is attainable and knowable, ſo it is very comfortable to a man to know it. It's good news to this toſt Pſalmiſt, that he dare ſay, <hi>I wait, my ſoul doth wait;</hi> it's good news for the preſent. Read often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and improve that word, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Though a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet ſurely I know that it ſhall be well with them that fear God, becauſe he feareth before God.</hi> The very preſent reward, the Eccho of a good Conſcience is ſweet and comfortable, that the people of God can ſay, <hi>Our hearts are not turned back, nor our steps declined from thy way, though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death,</hi> Pſal. 44.18. O! How ſweet an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho hath that in a mans boſome? and a man that in a ſad condition will not be made up in the teſtimony of a good Conſcience, it is righteouſneſs with God to ſmite him with a rod dipped in his own guilt: Look to it, and make it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47356:152"/>
your ſtudy to have this ground of comfort when others fail. It's good when a man can ſay, I am ſore broken, yet my heart is not turned back, I am in the deeps, yet my ſoul waits; I cannot win at him, yet my feet have held his ſteps, his way have I kept, and not declined; and as this is ſweet and comfortable for the preſent, ſo will it be found for the time to come, when the waiter on God in duty ſhall be made to ſay and ſing, as it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. Lo, <hi>this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us, we will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, but when all coſts are reckoned, it ſhall be found, that a doer of duty, waiting for God, ſhall be no loſer, but a great gainer; and it ſhall never be grief of heart to him, that he made it his work to wait on him in his way, when others declined. As I cloſed the laſt day, with that word, <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him;</hi> ſo do I this day, whatever he do to them, whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays or difficulties they meet with, they ſhall find, that it will be found a rich mercy, to be found waiting for God, and upon God in their duty, keeping his way, and not declining therefrom. I ſay no more, but the Lord bleſs his Word that ye have been hearing, for Chriſts ſake.</p>

            <p>I Told you, that as the two former Verſes ſpeak to one of the excellent Priviledges of the godly man, to wit, the remiſſion of ſins. So the 5, and 6. ſpeak to a moſt neceſſary, though a moſt difficult taſk of the godly man to wait for God, that godly men give a proof of their ſubjection to him, and faith in him, by their waiting for
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47356:152"/>
him, notwithſtanding they meet with ſo many delays and diſappointments.</p>
            <p>Somewhat hath been ſpoken to three principal Heads of Doctrine in theſe Verſes, 1. The Pſalmiſts exerciſe, he is a waiting man, he is put to wait, and he doth wait; where ye heard, that if God delay the Saints, and put them to wait, it is their duty to wait, not only not to be haſty, but if they hing on, they would look their waiting be not poiſoned with fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fulneſs, paſſion and bitterneſs, but ſeaſoned and adorned with meekneſs and patience. I ſpoke 2. to the object of his exerciſe, <hi>I wait for the Lord;</hi> where ye heard, that the eyes of the wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing man muſt be taken off all things, and ſet on God, not only when all ſecond cauſes forſake him, but when theſe things that ſeemed to promiſe relief ſeem to be againſt him, he muſt notwithſtanding wait on God, and keep his way, and have all his expectation in God, or God himſelf muſt be his expectation, and he will be no loſer by this; if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be his great expectation, he will eaſily make up the want of all other things. In the third place I ſpoke to his affection in waiting, <hi>my ſoul doth wait;</hi> where beſide that general, that we ſhould be able to give an account what we are doing in difficulties, when we are exerciſed with delays: Ye heard, that true waiting lyes in the midſt, betwixt bitterneſs, paſſion, haſte, fretfulneſs on the one hand, and ſtupidity and indifferency on the other hand. The right waiter for God, as he is not fretful and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, ſo neither is he ſleeping and careleſs; he ſo waits, as his ſoul doth wait, his affections are aloft, prizing and looking out for theſe things he is waiting for.</p>
            <p>Now in the 4. place, I proceed to conſider his ſupport in waiting; What made him thus wait affectionatly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and patiently? He Anſwers, <hi>and in his word do I hope:</hi> He hoped in the word of God, and therefore he waits for God. It's not to great purpoſe to trouble
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47356:153"/>
you here with an exact diſtinction betwixt Faith and Hope; Faith looks to the promiſe, and gives a preſent ſubſiſtence to the thing promiſed, as the word is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubstance of things hoped for, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen.</hi> Hope looks to the performance of the good things promiſed; Faith cloſes with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as true, and is comforted in that which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. Hope looks out till God come and make out what Faith ſees and cloſes with in the word of promiſe. In this place Faith and Hope may be taken promiſcuouſly or indifferently, <hi>in his word do I hope;</hi> that is, I wait till God make out to me that he hath promiſed in his Word; or take it a little more diſtinctly, <hi>in his word do I hope:</hi> It will import, that having cloſed by Faith with the good things in the word of promiſe, he looks out for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of them; ſo that he hath not only Faith bene, believing and cloſing with the Word, but he hath hope looking out till God make his Word good to him. I might here take notice of this, that waiting on God, though a man had no other, evidence, is ground of hope, when a man is in a difficulty, and ſore put at, and yet he is born up in waiting on God for an out-gate, he cannot quite nor give over, he cannot go to another door for relief, that's a good evidence that there is ground of hope in ſuch a mans lot; <hi>For certainly</hi> Pſal. 9.18, <hi>the needy ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be forgotten, the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their very waiting on, and not giving over, is, if they could but diſcern it, a ſufficient refutation of their temptation to diffidence and deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave this, and look on the words another way; and theſe two principal Doctrines are obvious from them to any capacity.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:47356:153"/>
               <item>1. That waiting on God needs the ſupport of Faith and Hope.</item>
               <item>2. That Faith or Hope muſt have the Word of God for its ground.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is clear, in that he ſays, <hi>I wait,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hope. The other is clear from that he ſays, <hi>in his word do I hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, That waiting on God needs the ſupport of Faith or Hope; Patience and On-waiting will never be gotten well, cheriſht without Hope or Faith; a man that would keep waiting on God, would keep Faith and Hope on foot: So doth the Pſalmiſt here, while he tells that he waits, becauſe he hopes. And hence it is, that in Scripture we find a frequent conjunction of Faith and Patience, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. The <hi>followers of them, who through faith and patience have inherited the promiſes.</hi> Rev. 13.10. <hi>Here is the faith and the patience of the Saints,</hi> they muſt go together. Rom. 8.25 <hi>If we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it.</hi> It's hoping for that which is not ſeen, that draws along a patient wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. True patience is called, <hi>the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of hope,</hi> that patience which is the product of hope. And (to add no more) ye have them conjoyned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35, 36. Where in the firſt place, the Apoſtle ſays to them, <hi>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath a great recompence of reward;</hi> and then he adds to good purpoſe, <hi>Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the promiſe:</hi> Intimating, it is to no purpoſe to ſpeak of patience, if folk caſt away their confidence; thus ye ſee how theſe two, Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, or Patience and Hope are linked together in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to tell, that patient waiting on God, hath need of the ſupport of Faith and Hope: And if we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low out this a little more diſtinctly, we will find that the brangling of Faith and Hope cuts Patience ſhort; when
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47356:154"/>
a mans Faith or Hope fails, he gives over waiting on God, his Patience is gone, as in that wicked King,, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33 Who when God by the Prophet had promiſed delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would not believe it, but ſays, <hi>This evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> Fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> once he caſt off confidence, he gave over waiting on God: And to clear this further, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. and 18 12. In the one place, when the Lord is perſwading his people to keep his way, they ſay, <hi>There is no hope;</hi> and what follows on that? They ſay, <hi>We have loved ſtrangers, and after them will we go.</hi> And in the other place, when they ſay,, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> they add, <hi>But we will walk after our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</hi> Thus ye ſee, how on the one hand the brangling of Faith and Hope cuts the throat of patient waiting for God; and on the other hand, Faith and Hope entertained, keeps life in patience, to wait ſtill on God, Ye know what is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.5 <hi>He truſted in the Lord God of Iſrael, ſo that after him was none like him among all the Kings of Judah, nor any that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> Truſt in God made him ſingular; and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth the ſingularity of a Chriſtian appear more than in this, the drawing forth of his Faith in patient waiting on God in difficulties, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. When <hi>David</hi> gives over confidence, he gives over patience and waiting, and goes down to the Land of the Philiſtines; but look upon him again as a Believer, holding faſt co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fidence, what ſays he? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, unleſs I had believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> Nothing but Faith kept me from giving over: But now (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.10. <hi>I believed, therefore have I spoken</hi>) attaining to believing, he dare ſubjoyn, as <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thy heart; wait I ſay on the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye have the point generally cleared, that patient
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47356:154"/>
waiting on God, needs the ſupport of Faith and Hope; To break it a little ſmaller, and bring it nearer you, I ſhall branch it out in theſe two.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the trials of the people of God may be ſuch, as only Faith can ſee an out-gate.</item>
               <item>And 2. When they are ſo, Faith will ſee an out-gate, and enable a man to wait on God for the out-gate.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, I ſay, The trials of the people of God may be ſuch, and ſo ordered for their greatneſs, ſharpneſs, darkneſs, and continuance, that an out-gate will be the object of Faith only, and not of Senſe nor Reaſon. A mans trials may be ſuch, that if he will betake him to Senſe and carnal Reaſon, to ſee if there will be an end of the Lord, he will give it over if Faith ſtep not in, and take him off the hand of both: A waiter for God here under difficulties muſt be a hoper, elſe he will not wait on; we are generally called in the whole courſe of our life to walk by Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>We walk by faith, and not by ſight;</hi> but eſpecially in great and eminent trialls and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, when they are of a long continuance, to prove that we are among the juſt, that live by faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38 I might inſtance this, both in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the long continuance of trials. In the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of trials, which may be ſuch as Faith only can ſee an iſſue, 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8 — <hi>In the trouble that came to us in Aſia, we were preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, in ſo much that we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That it is only Faith that can diſcern the iſſue. I ſhall briefly clear this to you in four words, 1. He doth it, that he may acquaint his people with the ſolid truth of his promiſes, that he may let them ſee, and bring them to know experimentally, that his promiſe is not a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>lume; but though all things in the world were againſt us, it's a <hi>true word,</hi> it's a <hi>tryed word, like ſilver purified ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times in the furnace,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. and ſhall have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. The longer folk reſt on the Bible, and the more they try it, they will eſteem of it the more: It's of Divine Authority, (to which I ſhall ſpeak a word af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when I come to that of the Pſalmiſt, where he calls it <hi>his Word.</hi>) 2. For this end the Lord gives this work to the faith of his people, that he may acquaint them more and more with himſelf, in whom they believe; that when they are put to the Bible, to live by faith in his Word, they may ſtudy his Divine Attributes, his Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that cannot lie, his Omnipotency, that in greateſt difficulties, can commad deliverance to his people; his
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47356:155"/>
infinite Wiſdom, that can by contraries bring out his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom about their delivery; and by this means they have a great advantage, when they are brought to know God the Author of the Promiſes better: Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t's ſaid, <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee;</hi> They that know him, will put their confidence in him: And <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. ſaid, <hi>For the which cauſe I ſuffer theſe things, nevertheleſs I am not aſhamed.</hi> How is that? <hi>For I know whom I have believed, and am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him to keep, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that day;</hi> therefore I am not aſhamed, therefore my confidence ſuccumbs not. 3. The Lord by giving Faith, this work brings his people experimentally to know the worth of Faith, and that's a neceſſary Leſſon; we will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y get Sailing near the Shore, within ſight of Land, but muſt Lanch forth into the deep, that Faith may be put to it; and in this caſe, what advantage is it to know the worth of Faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, unleſs</hi> I <hi>had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> What had become of me if I had not believed? And that gave him to know the worth of Faith, which had an excellent advantage: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.7. <hi>My heart trusted in him, and I was helped;</hi> I never tryed Faith, but it brought me ſome eaſe and relief, though not a compleat out-gate. And 4. The Lord give faith this work, that he may get much glory of his people, by their dependance, hoping and believing: Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Abraham was ſtrong in the faith, giving glory to God.</hi> Thou thinks it would honour God much, if thy mouth were filled with ſongs for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries, ſweet comforts, love-blinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I grant theſe are ſweet, and ſpeaks his praiſe; but God is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by believing, when thou wants theſe, and hath only his naked word to lean to, thou then glorifies God more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, though not ſo ſatisfactorily to thy ſelf, when thou ſticks by believing in continued difficulties, when thou art tempted to caſt away confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:47356:156"/>All I ſay from this Branch, and come to the 2d. ſhall be to tell you, that were theſe things believed, we would not be ſo ready to ſtumble, whatever our difficulties were, when ſenſe and carnal reaſon were laid by and non-pluſs'd, with want of all appearances and probabilities of an iſſue. But who are they who when they are left on a word of God, do not find themſelves at a loſs, and as ye uſe to ſpeak, at the next beſt; whereas, if we conſidered that this were God: way to exerciſe his people, with ſuch great and continued Trials, that their Iſſues and Out-gates from them, may be the Object of Faith, and not of Senſe or carnal Reaſon; and particularly were this ſtudied, our being holden long at work, hinging on would not tempt folk to weary, and give over waiting on God; a thing which many of us have cauſe to mourn for; and many fear, that if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine us with ſilver, we will diſcover more than we thought had been in us. O conſider it, that ye ſtumble not, weary not, fret not, quite not your confidence; in great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued troubles, it is an evil not ſo much to be dung from your confidence, as to take the pet, to caſt it away, and give way to diſcouragement, and lie down and die.</p>
            <p>But to preſs this, I come to the ſecond Branch in the Point, That as the Tryals of Gods people may be ſuch as only Faith can ſee an out-gate; ſo when they are ſo, Faith if it be chearfuly employed, will apprehend a promiſed delivery in greateſt difficulties; it will make a man wait on God in the ſaddeſt exerciſes without ſuccumbing, and to ſay this with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I wait,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for I hope in his word:</hi> If a man be living by Faith, and ſo a juſt man, Though the Viſion tarry to ſenſe, it will make him wait for it, and expect it, becauſe at the appointed time it will ſpeak and not lie: And for the grounds on which this truth is founded, amongſt others, take theſe three: 1. That let Tryals be never ſo great and long continued, they alter not the ground of Faith, the ground that Faith goes on ſtill continues the ſame. Whatever befal the people of God
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47356:156"/>
they get not a new Bible, or a new God; all the gloomy days that paſt over them, has not blotted out one Promiſe or Attribute of God; and theſe things they ſee in God, and his Promiſes in a fair day, they may ſee them to be the ſame in a foul day; now if the ground be the ſame, if the Promiſes be the ſame, if God be the ſame, if our Rock have not ſold us; Faith cloſing with that ground, muſt wait for a delivery; were the Tryal never ſo great and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. 2. As the ground that Faith goes on, does ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame; ſo obedience to the Command of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is never diſpenſed with; There is never a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſays, I will diſpenſe with you to Believe; he ſays not, believe when the waters are at the ancles, and I will diſpenſe with you when they overflow the banks; but go things as they will, Faith is ſtill a commanded and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty, ye have this clear, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.50. and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel places, when that Ruler came to Chriſt about the curing of his ſick daughter, he is encouraged to believe, while ſhe is ſick and not dead, but when ſhe is dead, one comes from his houſe, and ſays to him, <hi>Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Maſter,</hi> thou and we might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the more before ſhe was dead, but now the caſe is deſperat, therefore it is needleſs to thee to employ him any more: But doth Chriſt homologat ſuch a principle? no; but when he heard it, he ſays to the man, <hi>Fear not, believe only,</hi> for ſhe ſhall be made whole; when ſhe is ſick, and when ſhe is dead, he is bidden, believe only. And, 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That not only does the ground of Faith continue the ſame, and the command of Believing indiſpenſible; but Trials eminent, ſharp, and of long continuance, are opportunities of eminent work for Faith. He is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a man of courage, that in a Muſter, will vapor and play the gallant; but who in the Chock of the Battle kythes his ſtoutneſs and reſolution, as a famous Spartan ſaid, when it was told him the <hi>Perſians</hi> arrows were ſo thick, that they would cover the Sun, all the better of that, ſaid
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47356:157"/>
he, for us, we ſhall fight the better in the cool; ſo it is with Faith. Eminent Trials, and difficulties of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, gives to it opportunities of eminent ſervice and work: What is it to believe, while thou art ſailing alongſt the ſhore, but when thou lancheſt out into the deeps, and meets with a ſtorm, and neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars for many days appear, when the tryal is hightned and length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſome falls off on that hand the day, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fall off on this hand the morrow, and thou art like to be left alone; that is an opportunity of eminent ſervice and work for Faith: And thou would remember that there is a favour conferred on thee, when thy Faith is put to it, at ſuch a time, what will thou do? If thou will caſt thy ſelf, and all thou haſt, over upon God put all in his reverence, and wait upon him for an iſſue.</p>
            <p>From theſe things that I have but ſuperficially touched, be exhorted to ſtudy the life of Faith better, that ye may be fixt and ſtrong in the Faith; ye muſt not content your ſelves with putting out ſome acts of Faith, but ye muſt learn to live by it, to make it your food and ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which, if well ſtudied, many a tentation and ſnare, in ſnary times, would be broken, and God would be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon patiently. It is true, when ye are ſurcharged with bitterneſs, ye will get enough of things to father it on; your difficulties are many and great, your delays are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but ye light not on the root of your diſtemper, the weakneſs of your Faith; O thou of little faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore didſt thou doubt? where is thy faith? for <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.16. <hi>He that believes ſhall not make haſte;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that makes haſte, does not believe, or is at a low pace, as to the exerciſe of faith, when impatience and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs prevails; and therefore guard againſt your canke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fretfulneſs, wearineſs, fainting. Do not tempt God to give you a relief by a change of your condition, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen on the mount; but rouze up your faith to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſay, how is it that I am ſo fearful? how is it I have

            <p>WAiting on God being a moſt excellent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Subject and Duty, in regard that only they that endure to the end, ſhall be ſaved; and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47356:158"/>
that it is theſe whoſe Patience has had its perfect work, that ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord: we had need to ſtudy all theſe things, which may either ſet Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on work, or keep it at work. And here I am upon the great ſupport of the Waiting Man, <hi>He waits for the Lord,</hi> becauſe <hi>he hope in his word.</hi> In the Forenoon I ſpoke to the firſt general Obſervation, in theſe words, <hi>That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Waiting cannot be well cheriſhed, without Faith and Hope;</hi> Which <hi>I</hi> branched out in two, That the Tryals of the Saints may be ſuch, and ſo ordered for greatneſs and continuance; that Faith only will be able to diſcern an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of them; and that faith chearfully employed, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this iſſue.</p>
            <p>Now the Leſſon I am to fall upon in the 2d. general Obſervation is, That Faith enabling to endure hard lots, and to endure without ſuccumbing, muſt take the Word of God for its ground; and Faith having the Word for its ground, ſo long as God alters not his Sentence in his Word, Faith muſt believe and hope, expect the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that word, <hi>I hope in his word,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt;</hi> hence it is (to allude to that of the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 6.) That the man that would live by Faith, he muſt not ſay in his heart. <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven, to bring down Chriſt,</hi> or an iſſue from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to bring up a Chriſt, or an iſſue from the dead? <hi>But the word is near thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart;</hi> The Word of Faith, the Word in the Goſpel which we preach.</p>
            <p>This Point, becauſe there are ſeveral things in it of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial concernment for us, I ſhall deduce and branch out to you in four Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That really needy Saints, who are put to live by Faith, ought to be, and will be much converſant with the Word, that they may know what is for them, and ſuitable to their caſe there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as really needy Saints will be much converſant
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47356:158"/>
with the Word, ſo they will judge of things according to the Verdict of the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That to fix them in that Reſolution, to judge of things according to the Word, they muſt fix this Principle, That the Word is of Divine Authority.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That having fixt this, That the Word is of Divine Authority, the Believer muſt ſend out his Faith to believe, and his hope to look for all that he finds in ſo Divine and ſure a Word.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, I ſay, That really needy Saints, who are put to live by Faith, ought to be, and will be much converſant in the Word, that they may know what is for them there, and ſuitable to their caſe; This is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imported in the Text, while he ſaith, <hi>I hope in thy Word;</hi> He muſt know what is in the Word, to lean his Faith and Hope upon; for except he know he cannot lean his Faith and Confidence on it: Hence <hi>David,</hi> a great liver by Faith, was much converſant with the Scriptures, they were his meditation, his meat, his delight; the men of his counſels, his guides, as ye may read at length, what his eſteem of the Scriptures was in that 119 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And this being ſo, it will infer not only, that really needy ſaints ſhould attend upon the Word preached; but more eſpecially, that they ſhould, and will be much at the privat ſerious reading of, meditation on, and peruſal of the Scriptures; a duty, that in the firſt place, I would prove to be a duty. And 2dly. preſs it on you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, it is needful to prove that it is a duty, that the Scriptures be read by all, in oppoſition to that curſed Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh principle, that will not allow any laick or privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without a peculiar licence, to read the Scriptures, whereby they turn that in a priviledge, and confer on ſome only, which God hath impoſed as a duty on all; yea, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo Tyrannical are they in this, that though they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome to read the vulgar Latin, or Tranſlations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it (as they have turned it in Engliſh) where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47356:159"/>
are, leſt if they ſhuld hinder them in the uſe of that, they ſhould read other Tranſlations without their liberty; yet in other places, as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> they are ſparing of theſe Licenſes. This is a damnable error, not only contrair to the way of the ancient Church (wherein they glory ſo much) wherin privat perſons were ſo well acquaint with the Word, that they would make it the ſubject of their diſcourſe, while they were about their ordinary callings; but is clearly repugnant to Scripture, and principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced therefrom, both in the Old and New Teſtament. I ſhall not inſiſt on controverſial things, but lay down firſt, ſome inſtances from Scripture, to which I ſhall add ſome Scripture arguments for clearing that Truth.</p>
            <p>For Scripture inſtances, look to the Old Teſtament, it is marked, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. That in old time, <hi>Moſes</hi> had in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City them that preached him, being <hi>read in the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues every ſabbath day;</hi> and not the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> only, but the Prophets: And therefore our Lord in his ſolemn Sermon, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17. Read out of the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that Book being delivered to him: Beſide publick reading of the Scriptures, we find privat reading enjoyned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. The King was to have a Copy of the Law in a Book, out of that which was before the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits, to be with him, and he was to read therein, all the days of his life. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8. The Commander of the people <hi>was not to let the book of the Law depart out of his mouth, but to meditat therein day and night:</hi> It was alſo to be read by mean perſons, for <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. Theſe words command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Jews, they were to teach them diligently to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to talk of them when they ſat in their houſes, when they did walk by the way, when they did ly down, and when they roſe up;</hi> and this they could not do in all the ages of their Church, unleſs they read the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> was gone. We find that Eunuch in returning from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in his journey, reading the Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.30. We find <hi>Timothy from a child inſtructed in the Scriptures,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:47356:159"/>
3.15. drinking it in with his milk; and in a word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. We find the bleſt man in thoſe days, and in all ages of the Church, to be that man, <hi>who hath his delight in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth meditate day and night:</hi> If again we turn to the New Teſtament, we find that Chriſt commands the <hi>Jews to ſearch the Scriptures, Joh.</hi> 5.39. We find the <hi>Bereans</hi> commended for comparing Chriſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Sermons with the Scripture, ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whether theſe things were ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. We find it required, <hi>That the word of Chriſt a well in us richly, in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another, Col.</hi> 3.16. which neceſſarily requires frequent reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we find the Apoſtle ſuppoſing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> read them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>We wrote none other things to you than that you read and acknowledge,</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Whereby when ye read ye may underſtand my knowledge:</hi> We find him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.16. <hi>When this Epiſtle is read amongſt you, cauſe alſo that it be read in the Church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewiſe read the Epiſtle from Laodicea;</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.27. <hi>He charges them by the Lord, that that epiſtle be read unto all the holy brethren;</hi> and if the Apoſtle <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.3. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces them <hi>bleſt, who reads the words of that propheſie,</hi> which is a dark obſtruſe Book. It is not the purpoſe of the Spirit of God, that other plain Scriptures ſhould be ſhut up from people.</p>
            <p>But 2. Unto theſe Scripture inſtances, we ſhall add a few Scripture Arguments, as 1. For what end were the Scriptures plainly and legibly written, and at firſt in a known language, if not to be made uſe of and read; when the Viſion is written and made plain upon Tables, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> tells the end of that is, <hi>That he may run that readeth it.</hi> 2. If the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, did not ſpare to preach their Doctrine in the audience of all, it cannot be rationally thought, but that we may read the Scriptures that contains the ſum of their Doctrine. 3. The Scriptures are not only written to all, but are recommended to all;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47356:160"/>
therefore they concern all, and are to be read by all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written afore-time, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to all the Saints. <hi>John</hi>'s 2d. Epiſtle was written <hi>to an elect lady;</hi> his 3d. Epiſtle <hi>to Gaius.</hi> In his firſt, he <hi>writes to fathers, young men, and children,</hi> and how irrational is it to aſſert, that that which is directed to all, ſhould be keep'd up from any concerned. 4. The uſe that all have for the Scriptures, do prove, that they ſhould be read by all, they are the Rule by which we are to walk; and therefore the man that would walk right, muſt know the Rule: They are the Charter of our Inheritance, and that we be not cheated, we would know it. They are our elder Brothers Teſtament, and therefore we ought to read it, that we may know our Legacy: All the Epithets given to the Scripture in relation to our need, tell it is the will of God we ſhould be converſant with them. And Laſtly, There are many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required of Chriſtians, that they cannot perform, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be converſant with the Scriptures; they are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>try the ſpirits, whither they be of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. And how ſhall they try them, but by the Touchſtone of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They are bidden <hi>prove all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. And how ſhal they do that, unleſs they make uſe of the ſtandard of the Scripture, they are bidden <hi>add to their faith vertue, and to their vertue knowledge,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. And how ſhal they increaſe in knowledge, if the Scriptures be not converſed with? nay more, How ſhall ignorance be proven to be a ſin, if the Scripture, the only Illuminator of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, be not to be converſed with? But I ſhall forbear further debating with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the imitators (in this) of other Hereticks, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Lucifugae ſcriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> who while they prohibit the promiſcuous reading of Scripture, proclaim how little kindneſs they expect of the Scripture: It is with them as it is with a Tyrrant and his Subjects, he dares not truſt them with armsleſt they ſhould
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47356:160"/>
riſe againſt him; ſo they will not let people read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, leſt thereby they ſhould ſoon diſcover their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and cheats; therefore it is that they keep them in a maſs of ignorance, and pleaſe them with that, <hi>That Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is the Mother of Devotion.</hi>

            <p>But 2. To preſs this Duty upon you (for I would not ſo much have us Diſputants for this Truth, as Practiſers of this Duty) I would not have men having Bibles in their Houſes, and yet as little acquaint with them, as if they had none; if this be a duty, it would be followed forth in practice. I ſhall not enter upon the way of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture here, but in bearing home the practice of the duty, I ſhall ſay this: 1. Ye that have Children, train them up at Schools, a thing wherein the heat of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made the ancient Church very deficient, they had no Schools to put their Children to: But how made they up that loſs? by procuring Copies of the Scriptures, they got in ſome to read to them, whom they lodged with them, or going far to hear them read, by ſuch as could read them. And I might here inſtance <hi>Pambo,</hi> who came to a Friend, that he might read a <hi>Pſalm</hi> to him; and he beginning the 39 <hi>Pſalm, I ſaid, I will take heed to my way, that I ſin not with my tongue;</hi> hold there, ſaid he, till I learn that well; and when he came again, being asked why he tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo long away; O ſaid he, I think that one leſſon of the Government of the Tongue, ſhall ſuffice me all my life: But this I leave as a digreſſion. But if theſe who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Schools, were put to ſuch pains and charges to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that defect; what a great defect is it in you that have Schools; and yet there are ſo many of you in the place and Countrey about, that can read none at all; Is not this a great neglect of a ſpecial mean of Salvation, and to find it in ſuch a place, where Religion has had countenance, and where Learning might be had with eaſe, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons ſhould be found not able to read the Scriptures; O what a lamentable defect is it, and I wiſh it may not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47356:161"/>
be continued in, in this generation. And I ſhall add to this, of putting your Children to read, ye would beware of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to them while they are learning. This ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of Children is an ill ſymptom for the generation to follow; and more, it is a ſad preſage, that theſe your ſinful indulged Children, ſhall prove your greateſt plague, experience hath proven it, and ye would look to it; if the Children ye have indulged, do skaith to Church or State, readily ye may get the firſt draught of the Cup, they will be your greateſt croſs.</p>
            <p>But 2. I would recommend to you, that ye that can read, would make uſe of that gift, that is a thing ye may do with little interruption to your lawful affairs, and a thing ye have liberty to go about without hazard; ye are not like <hi>Incodemites,</hi> as many are called in other parts of the world, wherein Inquiſitions are ſo terrible to people, that if they have a Bible, or any portion of it, they muſt hide it for fear of the Inquiſition; ye are not in that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; and if ye refuſe to make uſe of the Scripture when it is dadded on you, and have liberty to be converſant with it; it ſhall be righteouſneſs with God to take that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from you, and give you up to Inquiſitions, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that dreadful neglect. I ſee Bibles among you, and bleſs God for it; but it is not enough to have them, go through them, and ſeek to be acquaint with the mind of God held out to you in them.</p>
            <p>But to preſs this duty a little more diſtinctly, I would briefly point at four or five things, which I would have you to conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would have the excellency of the Scripture conſidered; ye know men of Spirits, if they hear of an excellent Book written by a very learned perſon O how would they long for it, be at pains to have it, and read it? how greedily will ſome ſeek after, and peruſe Hiſtories and Romances, who are little in reading the Scripture; but I ſhall come nearer you: If there came News to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47356:161"/>
were a Book written by God in <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countrey, how would it be longed for? how would ye be earneſt to ſeek and peruſe it? and if ſo, what a ſin and a ſhame is it, when that Book inſpired by the Spirit of God, written by infallible Inſtruments, is among your hands? and yet how many are there, that neither in their Families, nor in ſecret have a teſtimony of their reading of it? what a monſtruous neglect is it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that it is a mean of God's Converſe with us; There is a double mean of intercourſe and converſe betwixt God and us; on our part, we converſe with him by Prayer, by ſending up our beggar ſupplications to Him; we traffick with Heaven by our neceſſities vented in Prayer to God, upon the one hand; and upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, it is by theſe Scriptures that God correſponds viſibly with us, and ſends meſſages to us: Hence I infer, (and look to it) That neglecters to converſe with the Scripture, not only obſtruct God's intercourſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocks him to give up correſpondence with them in his Word: nay his dwelling in them, for <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>abiding in us, and we in him,</hi> he ſays. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words in you,</hi> he in ſtead of putting in his <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding,</hi> puts in his <hi>words abiding in us;</hi> becauſe it is by his <hi>word he abides in us:</hi> But I ſay, it is to be feared, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecters of converſe with the Scripture, not only obſtruct God's correſpondence with, and dwelling in them; but that they alſo cut ſhort the converſe on their ſide with Heaven, by needy Prayer. Let them never ſay, that they are ſerious in Prayer, that neglect to read the Scriptures; though a man may read much, that prays not (for theſe are not reciprocal) yet he can never be ſerious in prayer, that reads none; he muſt be a delighter in the Scripture, that converſes with God by prayer; if then ye neglect reading, ye not only obſtruct Gods intercourſe with you, but yours with him.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall add in the 3d. place, there is not a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47356:162"/>
mark of Grace and Regeneration, nor to be much acquaint and converſant with the Scripture, delighting therein, and feeding thereon. I ſhall not urge that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Axiom <hi>iiſdem nutrimur ex quibus conſtamus</hi> we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed of the ſame things we are made of; but I ſhall give it you in Scripture terms: Compare theſe two, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. and 2.2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the one paſſage, it is ſaid, <hi>Ye are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> In the other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>as new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</hi> If a man be begotten and born by the word, he will deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that he may grow and be nouriſhed by it; and in this, I may allude to that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.93. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou haſt quickened me.</hi> A man that hath found the Word powerful, pulling him from Nature to Grace, from the power of Sathan to God, will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, but muſt be converſant with it.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall add in the fourth place, as the frequent uſe of the Scripture is a bleſſed proof of Regeneration, ſo it is an evidence of a tender man: The untender man takes advice from any thing, that may bring him pleaſure, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or preferment, and accordingly ſteers his courſe; but the tender man muſt have directions from the Word, elſe he will not ſtir in any thing; he far tranſcends theſe <hi>Grecians,</hi> who being at their Sacrifice, would not ſtir from it, though the enemy approached, and killed ſome, and wounded others, till they got ſome good ſigns, and then they got up, and went to it: So the tender man in all his caſes and difficulties, will take his directions from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and then he goes to it for his encouragements; and hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The bleſt man is he who delights in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth meditat day and night.</hi> He muſt not want his Bible, what ever he want: and that is a tender man who like <hi>David</hi> in a diſtreſs, muſt encourage
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47356:162"/>
himſelf in the Lord his God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. or elſe he will not be encouraged.</p>
            <p>There is a 5th. thing that preſſes this duty of converſing with the Scripture, and it is the thing in hand, the godly man hath ſo many needs, that he muſt not want the Bible to make up and ſupply them, he is put to fend by Faith and Hope, and Faith and Hope muſt not want the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ground of both; there is no paſture for Faith and Hope but the Scripture: Therefore the godly man muſt be converſant with it, he muſt have his all in God, and muſt ſtudy to know the mind of God that he may pleaſe him in all things. The godly man is called to live by Faith, and muſt know what Faith hath to feed on, and this puts him to converſe with Scripture. As I ſaid before, The Bible is the Charter of his Inheritance, the Rule that he muſt walk by, his Elder Brother's Teſtament, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs he muſt ſteer his courſe by in ſtorms, his Magazine for weapons and furniture, his Touch-ſtone, that he muſt try all Duties and Comforts by; in all theſe, and many mo, he hath need of the Bible: and therefore if his grace be in exerciſe, he muſt be much converſant with it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not fall on any of the other Heads, but exhort you, <hi>while ye have the light, to walk in the light,</hi> and while ye walk in the light, make uſe of the Bible; let this Word not be ſown in the wind, but <hi>let it be as a good and a nail faſtened by the Maſters of Aſsemblies.</hi> Acquaint your ſelves with the Bible through and through, read it, and depend on God for the bleſſing, delight in it, meditat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereby ye ſhall evidence your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of, and converſe with God, your Regeneration and walk with God, that ye dwell in God, and have your all in him, and that ye reſt on what he has ſpoken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for making up all your wants. <hi>God bleſs his Word to you for Chriſts ſake.</hi>

               </gap>led and ſtocked, that would engage in ſuch an undertaking, leſt they weary of waiting on God, and row to ſome other ſhore; and this is it that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here is from his own experience and practice, directing us in; after that he hath in the firſt place aſſerted his wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and next his waiting for the Lord. And 3. That his waiting is not degenerat in a careleſs indifferency and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity; but however, he did caſt out bitterneſs, haſte and fretfulneſs out of his waiting; yet it did not cool, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was not blunted <hi>for his ſoul did wait;</hi> after that, I ſay, he proceeds to give an account of his ſupport in waiting, <hi>my ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope;</hi> he tells that it was Faith and hope that enabled and ſupported him <hi>to wait for God.</hi> Ye may remember, that the firſt note I took up here was, That <hi>waiting on God</hi> will not be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cheriſht without faith and hope; <hi>I wait for the Lord my ſoul doth wait,</hi> becauſe I hope. The Tryals of the people of God for greatneſs, ſharpneſs and continuance, may be ſo ordered, as an out-gate from them, can only be diſcerned by faith, and looked after by hope; yet when it is ſo, that things are moſt dark, faith chearfully imployed, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a promiſed delivery in the greateſt difficulties; Faith will ſee an iſſue worth the waiting for, <hi>I wait, and I hope,</hi> ſays he. The ſecond general Obſervation that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from theſe Words was, that the faith and hope that ſends a believer, and carries him through <hi>in waiting for God,</hi> that enables him to endure hard lots, without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbing,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47356:163"/>
muſt take the Word for its ground. I wait, becauſe I hope, and I hope, becauſe I have the Word of God for the ground of my hope. Ye know that I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak to four Heads, in the proſecuting of this Note, That really needy ſouls, who are put to live by Faith, ought and will be much converſant with the Word of God, to know what is for them, and their through-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. 2. That as they will be converſant with the Word, ſo they will judge of things according to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Word, that it may ground their Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Hope. 3. That to fix the Saints in this reſolution, and to the end they may lean weight on the Word, they would be fixt in this Principle, that the Word of God is of Divine Authority, and infallibly certain, <hi>In his Word do I hope.</hi> 4. That the waiter having fixt this Principle, that the Word is of Divine Authority, he muſt ſend out his Faith to believe, and his Hope to look for all he finds in ſo divine and ſure a Word, that he may be ſure under foot, as the Word of God makes him. It's his duty to put forth Faith and Hope to fend.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, that needy Saints, who are put to live by Faith and Hope, ought to be, and will be much converſant with the Word: I ſpoke to it the laſt day. I both proved it that it was lawful and incumbent on all to read and be acquaint with the Scriptures, againſt the tyranny of the man of ſin, that will have no Laick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s they call them, to read the Scripture without his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and I inſiſted to preſs the duty on you by ſeveral arguments, which I ſhall nor reſume. Only I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that it may be a Preaching daily practiſed, as ye would prove your ſelves to be among theſe bleſſed folk, who have their delight in the Law of God, and meditate therein day and night, who have the Word dwelling richly in you, that ye may be acquaint with the Charter of your inheritance, with your Card and your Compaſs, your el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47356:164"/>
Brothers Teſtament, the Magazine and Store-houſe of your Furniture, and Touch-ſtone whereby ye try all things. Let me, I ſay, exhort you, that that Preaching may be conſpicuouſly ſeen in your practice daily.</p>
            <p>A 2d thing in the point is, that as really needy Saints will be converſant with the Word, ſo they muſt learn to judge of things according to the rule of the Word; they muſt learn to be determined by what the Word ſays, to have the Scriptures ending all controverſies and debates, to have the Scriptures grounding their Faith and Hope in all things. The Pſalmiſt doth ſo here, he contents not himſelf to take a look of the word, but he is ſo acquaint with, and ſo improves it, as he lives by Faith and Hope in it. This Point will lead me to the 3d, and therefore I ſhall paſs it briefly, by recommending to all that would be acquaint with the Scripture, and judge things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, that they would avoid two extreams; one is, the practice of wicked men, who will not be determined by the Word, but live and feed upon their own preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dreams. Let the Word of God ſay what it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the generality of men, and the way wherein they walk, they will not take the Word for Gods final anſwer, but ſtill look out for ſome other thing from God, I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the generality of Church-members to none better than theſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. where Chriſt tells of the ill uſage of the Servants, ſent to ſeek the fruit of the Vineyard, and of their killing of the Heir, and ſaid, he will come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy theſe Huſband-men; they perceiving that he meant by them, (as the other Evangeliſt hath it), <hi>v.</hi> 16. ſay, <hi>God forbid:</hi> They would not take that for Gods final an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and ſo it is with the generality of men, ſpeak of the Scriptures in general to them, they will acknowledge them; but ſhew unto them, how the Scripture condemns their way, and what judgments it hath denounced againſt ſins that they are living in, they will not take that for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47356:164"/>
Gods final anſwer, they will ſtill look out for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing from God. I ſhall not ſtand on this, though it be the general diſeaſe of the viſible Church; but in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that extream of wicked men, I ſhall deſire you to mark that word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the ſame ſhall judge him at the laſt day.</hi> Thou wilt not take that word for Gods final ſentence, yet it is that which ſhall judge thee in the laſt day, and all ſelf-deceiving, and ſelf deluding ſouls ſhall find, God is, and will be no other thing, than what he hath declared himſelf in his Word to be. If this were believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laid to heart, folk would more labour to live ſo, as they may have the Word more their friend. But on the other hand, as men in making uſe of the Word, would guard againſt the preſumptuous dreams of wicked men, ſo they would guard againſt the faithleſs fears of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who ſee enough in the Word to make them and needy ſinners happy; but their fears, and want of probabilities lays them by from improving what they find in the Word for their comfort and encouragement in duty, and lean as little weight on the Word upon the one hand, as wicked men do on the other. I ſhall not reſume what I ſaid at another occaſion, what uſe ye ſhould make of reaſon in the matters of Religion: Sure ye ſhould make uſe of it for taking up things revealed in Scripture, in gathering what is expreſt therein, or may be drawn from it by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſequence. But ye would remember, that Reaſon muſt ſtoop to Divine Revelation; your Reaſon muſt ſtoop and ſtrike Sail to what God hath revealed in his Word, though ye have no probability of the thing; yea, though ye have probability of the contrary, remembring that <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not as man, that he ſhould lie, nor as the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent: Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? Hath he spoken, and ſhall he not perform
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47356:165"/>
it?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.4. <hi>In God I will praiſe his word.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.6, 7. <hi>God hath spoken in his holineſs, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, It's to little purpoſe to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in a waiting poſture, to offer to be acquaint with the Word, and make uſe of it, except they lean their weight on it, and be determined by it, otherwiſe a man may ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arve beſide his allowance, he may ſee enough in the Bible to make him up, and yet not be the better of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not captivat his ſenſe, reaſon, and carnal imaginations, to credit and lay weight on it.</p>
            <p>But to preſs and follow this forth, I proceed to the 3d thing I propoſed to be ſpoken to in this Head of Doctrine, and it is the main thing; to the end we may lean weight upon the Word, and it may put an end to all controverſies that may ariſe in our boſoms, we would fix this principle, that the Word of God is of Divine Authority, and of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible verity and certainty: That's a Principle a man that would live by Faith muſt fix, that as it is <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The Scriptures are the word of him that cannot lie.</hi> Here it is, that Faith reſolving to wait on God, muſt begin his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, to fix this well, that the Scriptures, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained therein, are the Word of the faithful God, that they are of infallible verity, and Divine Authority; and therefore when the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. is preſſing u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon believers, to take heed to the Scriptures, as <hi>a more ſure word of prophecy than the voice that came from heaven;</hi> He intimats in the two following Verſes, that that will be to no purpoſe, except they know firſt, <hi>that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation:</hi> The meaning whereof is not, that privat ſpirits muſt not Expone or give the ſenſe of Scripture, for the Paſſage ſpeaks not of the interpretation, or giving of the ſenſe, but of the authority of the Scripture. In which ſenſe Prophets were inſpired to reveal the Word of God, and his will betwixt him and men, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was betwixt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:47356:165"/>

               </gap> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Deorum Interpretes</hi>) and ſo the meaning is, that the Scriptures are not of any private inſpiration by men, but from God, as is contained in the reaſon which he gives in the next Verſe, <hi>For the Propheſie came not of old time by the will of men, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe ſure words of Prophecy (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould he ſay) to which I invite you to take heed, are of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, ſpoken by holy men, as they were inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit; and his ye muſt know and believe ere ye can receive light and comfort from them. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> dealing with <hi>Agrippa, Act.</hi> 26.27. preſſes him to look to the Scriptures Divine Authority, as being a ſolid ground of Faith, <hi>King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>believeſt thou the Prophets? I know that thou believeſt;</hi> he threaps upon him that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. This Principle being neceſſary to be fixt, our work in fixing it might ſoon be at an end, if we were quit of the wicked and perverſe clamours of Papiſts, who expecting little kindneſs of the Scriptures (as I aſſerted the laſt day) are in tops with it at every bout, they will have none to read the Scriptures without their licence, and when they are read, they will not have them a perfect rule for Faith and Manners, without their traditions, not will they grant that they can be underſtood without their interpretations. And in the point I am upon, they will not have the Scriptures to be of Divine Authority, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us (what ever Authority they have of themſelves) more than the Fables of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> without the teſtimony of their Church, ſo blaſphemouſly ſpeak they againſt that Scripture, from which they expect ſo little friendſhip. For us, we acknowledge it is a mercy that there is a Church to hand down the Scriptures to us, and that we have the teſtimony of the Church by her Miniſtry; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſure that teſtimony is not from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church only. The Ancients when they ſpeak of Teſtimonies concerning
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:47356:166"/>
the Doctrine of the Scriptures adduce the Teſtimony of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church (being then Orthodox) only among other Churches; and there are many other Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Proteſtants, who acknowledge the authority of the Scripture, and yet do not acknowledge the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Grecian, Ethiopian, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Churches, and others; whatever the Church do in aſſerting the Authority of the Scriptures, ſhe is in that like the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4. Who teſtified to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> concerning Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Come ſee a man that told me all that ever I did, is not this the Chriſt?</hi> but when they came to him on her information, they ſaid, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy information, and ſaying, for we have ſeen and heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world:</hi> They founded not their faith on her Teſtimony, though that was inductive to their meeting with Chriſt, but aſcended to their own perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was founded on their hearing of him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>But to batter out this a little, which ye may have to do with ere long, &amp; to let you ſee that the Scripture muſt not ſubject its authority to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; I ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe four: 1. I enquire whether they have given this Teſtimony or not? Further, Whether it be arbitrary for them to give it, or not? if it be arbitrary, and the Word have no Authority but at their pleaſure, they put a cheat upon the World, by aſſerting the authority of that which hath no antecedent authority in it ſelf: But if it be not arbitrary, but they are bound to give it, and have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Teſtimony already (as <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> long ago pronounced his authority in his Decretal concerning the Scripture) Then they can no more be heard, pleading againſt the Authority of the Scriptures, determining in theſe Controverſies that are betwixt them and us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who gives this Teſtimony? The <hi>Pope?</hi> or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel? or both? Again, How came they to give this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47356:166"/>
They are perſwaded, or not perſwaded; are they not perſwaded, and yet give it? then are they the grandeſt cheats in the world. If they are perſwaded, how came they to that perſwaſion? If they go up to the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, how was that Church perſwaded? and let them aſcend as far as they can aſcend, they muſt ſtill fiſt at ſome who were perſwaded of the truth of the Authority of the Scriptures, without any antecedent Teſtimony of the Church; as for Revelations witneſſing the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures, they will not pretend to them, they call us <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> (though falſely) on that account, and if they had that perſwaſion from the Scriptures themſelves, why may not others having the Spirit of God, diſcern that Divine Authority of the Scriptures, without the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church, as well as they?</p>
            <p>But I ſhall add 3dly. If any ſhould ask who gave them that warrand to determine concerning the Authority of the Scriptures? If they ſhould ſay to a <hi>Pagan,</hi> that is the Word of God, I ſay it, and I have authority to declare it; If the <hi>Pagan</hi> ſhould ſay, where is your evidence that ye have that authority? if they cannot adduce any, may not he juſtly alledge, that they bear Witneſs of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? All the evidence they afford to any is, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible; and when they are put to that, they adduce theſe paſſages, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. well, ſay I, have theſe Teſtimonies Divine Authority to perſwade men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> and muſt men believe that antecedently to their receiving their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerning the Scriptures? If ſo, then not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who teſtify, but others who are to receive their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, muſt be perſwaded of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures antecedently to that teſtimony. In a word, when they would prove their Authority, they run to the Scriptures, and in proving the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47356:167"/>
they recurr to their own teſtimony, and ſo run in a circle.</p>
            <p>I might add a 4th. thing to diſcuſs their Authority from their own principles; for the clearing of which, I ſhall hint at three words, <hi>I</hi> hope they will grant, that they who teſtify concerning the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, muſt be Chriſtians, not <hi>Pagans;</hi> Church-Officers, not Laicks; Now by their principles, how can they ſatisfie the Chriſtian world, that their <hi>Pope</hi> is not an un-baptized <hi>Pagan?</hi> or a meer privat perſon. I ſhall not found my doubt upon <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the Tenth his Creed, that ſaid, The Fable concerning Chriſt had been a gainful Fable; but upon their making the real adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to depend upon the real intention of the Prieſt that adminiſtrats them: And ſo I reaſon, it is impoſſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to know that the preſent <hi>Pope</hi> is a baptized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or a Church officer in regard we cannot know, what were the intentions of him that baptized or ordained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

know the Divinity of his Doctrine; nor is it, that the Word needs the charity of well diſpoſed perſons; but this is it, that he muſt be in a good frame, that would take up the Divine Authority of the Word; <hi>I</hi> mark it for this end, becauſe there are ſo many <hi>Atheiſts, Anti-ſcripturiſts,</hi> mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Scripture, denyers of the Being of Spirits, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and of Rewards and Puniſhments after this Life; and it is to little or no purpoſe to diſcourſe to them of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures.

               </gap>y. I am now upon the great Task of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> here, <hi>waiting for God.</hi> I have ſhewed the neceſſity of Faith and Hope, for that undertaking; the faſtning of Faith and Hope, in waiting, on its ſure ground, the Word of God. And I have laid before you the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquaint with the Scriptures; that it is your duty to be determined by the Scripture, and to judge of all things according to the verdict of the Word; and in proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, I am led upon this great Truth, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are of Divine Authority, they are the Word of God; I laid by the pretence of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to aſſert the Authority of the Scriptures, whoſe principles lead men in the matters of Religion to a labyrinth of unextricable uncertainties. Now it would remain, that I ſhould hint at ſome things to clear the Divinity and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47356:169"/>
Divine Authority of the Scriptures, and the Doctrine therein contained; not to Atheiſts, to Whom I ſpake a word in the cloſe of the mornings Exerciſe, but to ſober minded folk, who would fain have their Faith helped in that concern; and as the laſt day I recommended your Bibles to you to be made more uſe of, that ye might have <hi>the word dwelling richly in you:</hi> So this day <hi>I</hi> would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all, to take another, and a better look of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that they may ſee them, and the Doctrine held out therein, clearly and diſtinctly to be Divine. One word <hi>I</hi> premit, which would lead me to that <hi>I</hi> would ſpeak to here, and ye will find it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.152. You read it in your Tranſlation, <hi>Concerning thy teſtimonie. I have known of old, that thou haſt founded them for ever:</hi> but the Original reads it word for word thus. <hi>From thy testimonies I have learned of old, that thou haſt founded them for ever;</hi> wherein ye may take notice of theſe three, 1. What he learned concerning the Scriptures, that God had founded them for ever, that is, That they were, and are an unalterable and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation of Faith, having a Divine Authority ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon them. 2. When he learned this, <hi>of old,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from experience, but he learned it as the firſt principle he had drunken in, That was, would he ſay, the <hi>A, B, C.</hi> of my Religion, a <hi>Peter</hi> hath the word in that forecited place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Know this firſt,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Whence he learned this, <hi>From thy teſtimonies,</hi> I learned it, ſaith he, <hi>I</hi> needed not another evidence; thy Teſtimonies, when my eyes were open, diſcovered to me their divine authority, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible verity. Hence ye may gather, that which <hi>I</hi> cloſed with in the morning. That if ye ſuppoſe the Hiſtorical verity of the Scriptures, they will prove their Divinity, to any who have the Spirit of God, or to any who receive the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as a true Hiſtory, the Scriptures themſelves will prove themſelves to be Divine Writings.</p>
            <p>So here ye have 1. The Hiſtorical verity of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:47356:169"/>2. Their Divine Authority propoſed: and</p>
            <p n="3">3. The neceſſity of the Spirit to diſcern that:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe that men receive the Scriptures as a true Hiſtory, that is, that men will give that credit to the Word, that they give to any common Hiſtory, handed down to their days, to wit, that there was ſuch a Nation as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that there was ſuch a man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that gave them Laws, that was inſtrumental in working miracles, in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Wilderneſs; that there was ſuch an one as Jeſus Chriſt, that preached in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he had twelve Apoſtles that followed him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is to be ſuppoſed in this inquiry concerning the Authority of the Scriptures; neither is it irrational to ſuppoſe it. Though there be no veſtige of that antient City of <hi>Troy</hi> now, yet who doubts but ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was: And that <hi>Homer</hi> wrote not a meer Romance (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Poetical enlargements he has) when he wrote of it. Who doubts of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, though his Empire be now gone; and that <hi>Q: Curtius</hi> wrote of him. Who doubts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars and that <hi>Titus Livius</hi> wrote of them; when men get theſe Books in their hands, they look not on them as fables; and if ſo, how rationally do we plead, that the like Credit be given to the Scriptures, &amp; that they may have the like acceptance; if any account this irrational, he muſt grant that he will not believe any thing done before his own time, nay that he will not believe any thing done in his own time, if he ſee it not done with his eyes, and thus a man queſtioning the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical verity of things, ſhould nonpluſs himſelf with abſurdities, and declare that he were fitter for a Bedlam than to be Diſputed with.</p>
            <p>But 2. This being ſuppoſed, there is their Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority propoſed to be ſpoken to, the Scripture it ſelf will prove it ſelf, a true Divine word, they often do ſolemnly declare they are of God, that God ſpoke them to <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets, and aſſert that what they ſpoke are the truths
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47356:170"/>
of God, and that they do not cheat in this aſſertion, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will go through the Characters of the words Divinity, they will be convinced of it. But a man falling on that ſubject, muſt ſay, as Pſal. 106.2. <hi>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can ſhew forth all his praiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> might here ſpeak of the form and ſtile of Scripture, of the ſcope and end of it, leading to God, and Everlaſting happineſs, but I ſhall limit my ſelf to the antiquity of the Scripture, the inſtruments employed in tranſmitting it to us, the matter of the Scripture, the efficacy and ſucceſs of them, and the adjuncts of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the antiquity of the Scripture, that is moſt true, which is moſt antient, and ſo is the Scripture, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever error may plead antiquity, yet truth had ſtill the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart of it, from the beginning it was not ſo, ſays Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. What Book ſo antient as the Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> out of which the reſt are to be proven. The Hebrew was the moſt antient Language; <hi>Moſes</hi> who wrote in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language, was dead long before the <hi>Theban</hi> War, and Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> the firſt thing written by the Heathen; and for the antiquity of the matter, it is the moſt antient, the matter firſt, whereof it treats, concerning the Creation of the Heaven and the Earth, the Creation of Man, and his fall, the effects whereof the Heathen have felt, though they could not aſcend to the cauſe. The Hiſtory of the Worlds Creation being firſt, Man that was made the ſixth day could not have known, unleſs God had revealed it unto him: Nay <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. It ſpeaks of Promiſes made by God, that cannot lie before the World began, and that theſe are not Impoſtures of men, their accompliſhment in every age makes out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Inſtruments imployed in tranſmitting the Doctrine of the Scriptures to us, ſome of them were learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Moſes, Daniel, Paul,</hi> though all their Learning could not reach that Doctrine, but generally they were ſimple illiterat men; and to convince us further, their Doctrine
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:47356:170"/>
was of God, they could not be deceived, they would not deceive, and though they would, they could not deceive. 1. They could not be deceived, Why? Either they had their Doctrine from God, and a good Spirit, or from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and an evil Spirit; if they had it from God and a good Spirit, (as indeed they did have it) they could not be deceived; and from Sathan and an ill Spirit, they could not have it, for he would not inſpire Doctrine in men ſo deſtructive to his Kingdom and intereſt. 2. As they could not be deceived, ſo neither would they deceive; when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures comes out to cheat others, any with half an eye cannot but ſee ſome deſign in their cheat; but what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign could the inſtruments employed to carry this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine have? They walked not in craftineſs, they hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not the Word of God deceitfully; they affected not humane Wiſdom, but by manifeſtation of the Truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended themſelves to every mans Conſcience, as in the ſight of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. The world ſaw they reaped no advantage by their Doctrine, but a ſore skin; they relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht all their own intereſt, and worldly advantages, in their faithful diſcharge of their truſt. And 3. As they could not be deceived, and would not deceive, ſo though they would, they could not deceive, and that becauſe theſe things they preached, and wrote of, were not done in a corner, but before all; they came not out as the Papiſts, to tell of miracles in corners, which none ſaw but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but of things done in the open view of the world, ſo that if they had vented any untruth, there were myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads of men to witneſs againſt them, and give them the lie. <hi>Apian</hi> confeſſes many things concerning the Jews. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> confeſſe of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. That a notable miracle was wrought by them, which was manifeſt to all that dwelt at Jeruſalem, and none could deny it. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Heathens confeſſed, that many things were true of the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But 3. Let us conſider the matter of the Scriptures, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47356:171"/>
O! what beams of Divinity will we find ſhining there? look on it in the bulk, no ſuch ſyſteme of Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and his Attributes; the Creation of Man, and Providence; the Fall of Man, and his Redemption; concerning mans Duty, the immortality of the Soul, the reſurrection of the Body, Eternal Life and happineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as this Book holds out. Conſult all the Philoſophers, all the <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Brachmans,</hi> all the <hi>Magicians</hi> that ever ſpoke or wrot of Divine things, and put all their Doctrines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, they cannot parralel this Book and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in it, it is ſuch a compleat Tranſcript and Syſtem of Doctrine; and this proves it to be of God, Why? Could the mind of man what way ſoever, have found out what is in this Book? no certainly, theſe wonders of Nature, parts &amp; abilities, would never have left it to ſome poor illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat Fiſher Men to diſcover &amp; that they ſhould bring forth ſuch tranſcendent &amp; ſublime Truths, demonſtrats the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the word of God, Look upon it in the parts, the Hiſtories contained in it, though written by ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men, living in ſo far diſtant ages &amp; places of the world, yet have a wonderful harmony, holding out a true Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology and ſupputation of time, which proves their divine authority, and infallible verity. Here ye have a true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of what the Heathen involved in Fables, for (if it were fit to inſiſt on it) I could clear their firſt <hi>Saturn</hi> was <hi>Adam,</hi> and the next <hi>Noah,</hi> whoſe three Sons, <hi>Shem, Ham</hi> and <hi>Japheth</hi> were Transformed by them, <hi>Ham</hi> into <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Japheth</hi> into <hi>Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Shem</hi> (becauſe they hated the bleſſed race) into <hi>Pluto,</hi> and that all their other Fables are but obſcure and dark intimations of the Hiſtories, which in the Bible are clear and plain; here we have Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories not ſo much concerning great Kings and Princes, as of poor Believers, not ſo much concerning things that occurred, as the Providence of God in bringing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: And as Scripture Hiſtories are exact, true and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: So Scripture <hi>dogmata,</hi> and Doctrines are ſo clear,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47356:171"/>
many of them, and ſo conſonant with Natures light, that in ſome meaſure, they may be known by it, as that there is one God, the firſt cauſe of all; That it is reaſonable he ſhould be ſerved <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That reaſonable Creatures have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls, and die not as beaſts, which made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to cry out, as <hi>Deut</hi> 4.8. <hi>What nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous?</hi> and others of them, though they be not known by natural reaſon, yet they are not contrary to principles that are naturally known, concerning the Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God; and being revealed, will be acknowledged to be very rational: Thus though man know not the way of Redemption, but by Divine Revelation; yet he may find himſelf an object of pity, (which alone can be expected from God) and of juſtice, if he find not out ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Again, though ſome myſteries tranſcend the Light of Natural Reaſon, as the Trinity of Perſons, the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet that will not bring the Doctrine in queſtion, partly, becauſe no Doctrine, even of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but it hath its own ſecrets; and partly, becauſe there are many things in nature which we ſee are, and yet we cannot tell why, what, and whence they are. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſider the Scriptures, and as we will find them clear, as to the Hiſtories and Doctrines therein ſet down; ſo as to the Propheſies therein contained, we will find an exact anſwerableneſs of ſo many future events to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the Word: The Heathens hold their am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Oracles ſo adapted to the events, that they might put their own Commentars upon them; but as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is moſt diſtinct and clear in its Predictions, and in the circumſtances of things foretold. So there is an exact anſwerableneſs in the event, as in that of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from betwixt his feet, until Shiloh come:</hi> How exactly was it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht at the birth of Chriſt? and theſe Predictions, and their exact accompliſhments do evince, that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47356:172"/>
could come from none but the ſupream God, who is Omniſcient, and has a Dominion over the Univerſe, and who, becauſe He purpoſed theſe things foretold, &amp; brought them to paſs.</p>
            <p>But 4. Take a look of the ſucceſs and efficacy of Scriptures and Scripture Doctrine, and that will tell it is of God. I know not well where to begin or cloſe, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open this Conſideration; only I ſhall deduce it ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe four ſteps:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of the Scriptures proves it ſelf to be of God, by its prevalency in the World among men, and its prevalency when it had nothing extrinſick to back it, it hath come in on men when they read it, and hath been the miniſtration of death and terror, when all things were going well with them, and hath raiſed them out of the pit of deſpair, when all things ſpoke ſadneſs to them; It hath had a ſingular power in it, to terrifie and humble the mind of men, and then to give them peace and comfort, that they have been perſwaded (notwithſtanding long fix: in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſwaſions) to relinquiſh their former way with great joy, and to imbrace the greateſt miſery in the world, as their greateſt happineſs; and that it ſhould make ſuch a conqueſt on men, and bring in ſuch freſh ſweetneſs in the greateſt bitterneſs, it proves it to be Divine.</p>
            <p>To this ſecondly add the univerſality of this conqueſt in ſo ſhort a time. <hi>Paul</hi> carried the Doctrine of the Goſpel from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> round about to <hi>Illyricum, Rom.</hi> 15.19. and within 200 years or thereby, after Chriſt, it came the length of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and with whom did it prevail? not with a few of the meaner, but with many Learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, ſuch as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite, Juſtin</hi> Martyr, many who uſed curious Arts, who brought their books together, and burned them before all men, <hi>Acts</hi> 19 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9. with great men, Kings and Princes, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great and his ſucceſſors, not with moderat perſons only, but with enemies, with Judges, that ſat upon Benches and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47356:172"/>
the Saints, it made them come down from the Benches, and go with the Chriſtians to the Stakes; was not that a proof that the Doctrine was of God?</p>
            <p>And I ſhall thirdly add, that the Scripture and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof, was thus ſucceſsful, when it had nothing extrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck to commend it, but was every where oppoſed; Pagan Religion flouriſhes, but where it hath the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Princes to back it. The <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion alſo prevailed at firſt, becauſe it promiſes liberty from ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Superiors. The ſatisfaction of mens luſts and pleaſures while they live, and a Paradiſe of pleaſures when they are dead; but after its firſt prevailing, it hath not ſpread, but where the ſword made way for it; but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity a Sect every where ſpoken againſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. yet prevailing doth evidence it is of God. Conſider again the men that carried this Doctrine, poor men, inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant perſons, that were more ready to beget contempt of it, than reception of it; men that ſet not themſelves to ſeek mens intereſts, but preſſed them to <hi>deny all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fleſhly luſts.</hi> They held out no worldly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to men, to imbrace their Doctrine, but on the contrary, told them, that upon the reception of their Doctrine, they behoved to undergo the hardeſt of lots, and evil uſage in the world, whereof themſelves were viſible ſampla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and yet Chriſtianity prevailed, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel had ſucceſs, which proves it to be of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Religion and Doctrine had ſuch an impreſſion, that whoſoever embraced it, there was no parting of them and it; men might take their eſtates and lives from them, but could not part them and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and theſe were not fools, but men that in other things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced themſelves to be intelligent, ſober underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perſons; but when it came to the matter of their Religion, no torments deviſed by men could move them to relinquiſh it, but they did run to the Stakes, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47356:173"/>
themſelves willingly to the Fires, to the beheading Sword and other cruel deaths; and how could they have done this, if not ſupported by the efficacy of the Doctrine they had embraced, which proves it to be of God.</p>
            <p>In the 5. and laſt place, conſider the Adjuncts of this Doctrine of the Scriptures, the great miracles whereby it was confirmed; wonders may be wrought by the power of ſecond cauſes, but miracles are only of God, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, if not contrary to the courſe of nature. How clear and convincing were theſe miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Egypt?</hi> by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſo in that forecited place, <hi>Act.</hi> 4 16. The Rulers confeſs, that indeed <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miracle had been done by theſe men, is manifest to all,</hi> &amp;c. Their miracles were ſo clear, ſo infallible, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for kind, that it were blaſphemous to think or ſay, God would afford them to confirm any Doctrine but his own. And to this I ſhall add the providence of God, in preſerving the Scriptures, and the Church cleaving to the Doctrine thereof, againſt all the malice of Satan and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men bended againſt both. How long is it ſince they ſought to root out <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet ſhe is to the fore? How long ſince <hi>Antiochus</hi> made ſearch for all Copies of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, deſtroyed ſome, and ſought to deſtroy the reſt, and yet it is preſerved, and hath ſpread? How long ſince crouds of Errors and Hereticks have ſought to adulterat and corrupt the Scriptures, ſince the days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and yet the providence of God hath ſo vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly watched over it, that it is kept pure and uncorrupt, and ſo tranſmitted to us at this day in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> primitive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which no doubt would have done with the Scriptures, as they did with other Writings of the ancient Fathers, had they known that uſe would have been made of them againſt them: And to this I may add the providence of God againſt the Enemies of the Scriptures, and the Church profeſſing them, <hi>Antiochus</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:47356:173"/>
fell without hand, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy no ſooner med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but it came to an end; and in all ages the providence of God hath been eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, in the judgments of God upon theſe that oppoſed the Scriptures, and the Profeſſors thereof: Theſe are ſome evidences that the Scriptures are of God, and of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority.</p>
            <p>In the 3d place I told you, that beſide the Hiſtorical ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures ſuppoſed, and the Divine Authority of them propoſed, there is need of the Spirit to diſcern theſe things. I ſhall not trouble you with the quirks uſed by the Papiſts againſt us, concerning the Spirits teſtimony; it is not by way of <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> or any new Revelation, but by way of gift from God, opening our eyes to diſcern the wonders of his Law; and ſo it is not required to prove the Scriptures to be Divine, but to aſſure us they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; becauſe there be ſome to whom the Goſpel is hid: not that a ſaving work of the Spirit is requiſite to take up theſe evidences of the Divinity of the Scriptures, for a temporary may <hi>taſte of the good Word of God, and yet fall away,</hi> Heb. 6. But a common illumination of the Spirit is neceſſary to take up theſe evidences the Scripture gives of its Divinity.</p>
            <p>Now I have been long upon this Head which is Doctrinal, and though it be ſo, it ſhall not be in vain, if it be a mean to fix your Faith and Hope in this Principle, that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and of Divine Authority. The Scriptures are the Word of Truth, by which we are begotten, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>His Law is the truth,</hi> Pſal. 119.142. The Scriptures are <hi>a more ſure word of propheſie, whereunto ye do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. When <hi>David</hi> is comforting himſelf againſt the riſing of enemies, like the mighty Waters, and Waves of the Sea, he ſays, <hi>Thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are very ſure,</hi> Pſal. 93.5. And then, <hi>they are a tryed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47356:174"/>
word.</hi> Pſal. 12.6. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words, as ſilver tried in a furnace of earth, purified ſeven times.</hi> Ye would reduce theſe things to your practice, and ſeek to have the Word of God to be found that which it is called in your experience. But that which I intended to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, is to leave a ſad check upon the generality of you that ſee ſo little of God in your Bible. Something hath been ſaid to hold forth the Divine Authority of the Scriptures; but I confeſs it's but a ſpilt commendation that hath been given this word: yea, it fears me, more hath been ſaid, than even ye that have Bibles diſcern. O, will ye conſider how men of old have experienced the Divinity of this word, and have found it to be of God, <hi>and have fallen down and confeſſed, worſhipping God, ſaying, God is in you of a truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.25. All the fores that Chriſtianity now hath, do not contribute to make the Word ſo ſucceſsful as it hath been in times of perſecution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſo ſoon paſſed from by many in times of trial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Divine Authority thereof is not ſtamped on hearts, and God is not made uſe of and imployed to write it upon the heart. Let this be looked upon partly as the practical uſe of what ye have heard, partly to excite you to bleſs God ye have this Word: Ye are not behind, ſo long as ye have your Bibles, though ye were ſtraitned in many other things; and partly to humble you, that ye may bluſh and be aſhamed, that the Divine vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that wont to accompany the Scriptures, is ſo little found in this generation, and upon your hearts.</p>

This is it which I am now upon in theſe words, wherein the Pſalmiſt, after that he hath profeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he is waiting, waiting for the Lord, &amp; that his ſoul doth wait; he adds in the next place an account of his ſupport in waiting, that therefore he waited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hoped in the Word of God, <hi>I wait,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken already to the firſt general Doctrine in theſe words, that patient waiting on God cannot be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cheriſht without the exerciſe of Faith and Hope; no man can ſay, <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait,</hi> but he that can ſay, he hopes and truſts in God. I wait, (ſaith he) becauſe I hope. I have alſo near put a cloſe to what I would ſay from the ſecond general Obervation, to wit, that this Faith and Hope that ſupports the patient waiter for God, that ſends the believer, and carries him thorow in waiting for God, till the outgate come, muſt take the Word for its ground and meaſure; I wait, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hope, and hope, becauſe I have the Word of God for the ground of my hope. Ye may remember, that from this I have ſpoken to theſe three (which I wiſh may not evaniſh with the Preaching.) 1. That really needy Saints, put to wait for God, and in waiting for him, put to live by Faith and Hope, will be much converſant with the Word of God; they muſt learn to be acquaint with the Scriptures, to know what is there for their direction, or encouragement, or both. 2. That theſe who would wait for God in the way of believing and hoping, muſt learn to judge of things according to the Word, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47356:175"/>
by the Word, that it may be the ground of Faith, and beget Hope, otherwiſe it will be to little purpoſe for a man to be acquaint with the Scriptures from end to end, if he improve it not, but ſtarve beſide his allowance. And 3. For this end ſuch as are put to wait for God, and to have their encouragement from the Word; that they may lean weight upon it, they would be fixed in this Principle, that the Word of God is of Divine Authority, and infallible certainty; they would believe and hope in in it as Gods Word, <hi>In his Word do I hope.</hi> And as the day before I preſſed upon you th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uſe of your Bibles, that ye might be better acquainted with them, and with the grounds of your Faith and Hope therein contained; ſo the laſt day I inſiſted long to give you a right impreſſion of the Bible, that it is the Word of God, and of Divine Authority; the Hiſtorical verity whereof being granted, which cannot rationally be denyed, the Scriptures will prove themſelves to be of Divine Authority; and I would now intreat you to ſtudy theſe two Sermons well, that ye may have the Divine Authority of the Scriptures fixt upon your hearts, that ye may lay weight on them, feed on them, and converſe with them with more delight: And then what ſhall I ſay for the need of proofs for the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, when the efficacy of it upon your hearts ſhall be a proof thereof, as the effects and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of it of old is a ſtanding Witneſs, that it is not the word of man, but the Word of God, that works effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in them that believe.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to a 4 thing which I have yet to add, and that is to put the two Points together, Faith and Hope, <hi>and hoping in his word;</hi> That ſince we have the Scriptures, and ſince the Scriptures are of Divine Authority, we would put forth Faith and Hope to feed upon that which is contained there; Faith to believe, and Hope to look for all that we find in ſo divine and ſure a word, and that I
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47356:175"/>
may make ſomething out of this (and ſo have done with this <hi>Verſe</hi>) I ſhall hint at ſome things diſtinctly required, both to Faith and Hope.</p>
            <p>And 1. For Faith, the Apoſtle tells, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>That faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi> The word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) properly ſignifies, that it is the ſubſiſtence of things hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; Things hoped for being held forth in the Word, Faith gives them a ſubſiſtence, before they exiſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which is not to be underſtood abſolutely, for it is in the Promiſes of God, revealing the purpoſes he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things, and the Power of God effectuating them, that gives them an abſolute ſubſiſtence before they be; Faith gives them a ſubſiſtence inſtrumentally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, while it leads the believer to cloſe with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, wherein thoſe things ſubſiſts, and while it gives them a ſubſiſtence in the heart of the believing man. Now this ſubſiſtence Faith gives to things promiſed two ways. 1. More abſolutely, while Faith enables the believing man, to look on whatever God hath promiſed, as no leſs certain than if it were in his hand, like theſe that reckon their riches, not ſo much by their preſent ſtock, or that which they have in their hands, as by what they have owing them by Bonds of reſponſal Debitors. So the Believer reckons God's Promiſes as ſo many Bonds, making the things promiſed as ſure, as if they were in his hands, and this had need to be looked to by us; for I know not if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that hath the Promiſes among his hands puts forth his Faith vigorouſly to believe them; a man may have the Promiſes, and not contradict them, nor doubt of them, while he lets them ly by him, and does not rouze up his Faith to actual exerciſe in cloſing with them, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them; and when folks are not actually doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt finds it neceſſary to rouſe up and quicken them actually to believe, as <hi>Mark</hi> 11.22. <hi>Have faith in God,</hi> (ſaith he to the Diſciples) look that your Faith be on foot, and in exerciſe, that ye take not the Promiſes lying by you,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47356:176"/>
without contradicting them for Faith, but rouze it up to improve them: and <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. When Chriſt is holding out precious Promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>Martha, That he is the reſurrection and the life; That he that believeth on him, though he were dead he ſhall live, he ſhall never die:</hi> He finds it neceſſary to put her to it with this queſtion, <hi>Believeſt thou this?</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou wilt not doubt of it, <hi>Martha;</hi> but is thy Faith quickned, and put forth to exerciſe, on what <hi>I</hi> have ſaid to thee, actually to cloſe with it and reſt upon it, as the true and faithful ſayings of God?</p>
            <p>But 2. Faith gives things a ſubſiſtence, not only by way of contemplation in bringing the Believer to believe they are true, but by way of application to himſelf; that is, it ſo gives a Subſiſtence to them, as the believing man gets the ſubſtance of them (as the word is Tranſlated in that forecited place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.) for his preſent uſe, comfort and encouragement, till the performance come: It gives them a ſubſiſtence, when the ſubſtance of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is made out to the believer, as if they were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ye uſe to account them dyvors and ſpend chriſts that forenail their rent continually; but Faiths vertue ſtands in forenailing, yet without diminiſhing the things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the believer ſuſpends not all the things in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes till he get them in his hand the beeing of the Promiſe is a foundation to him, and Faith brings in the ſubſtance of the thing promiſed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Though he ſee not Chriſt, yet believing, he rejoyceth with joy unſpeakable and full of glory:</hi> and it is a notable word which ye have, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi> He is not a man only that ſhall have everlaſting life but he hath it already in ſeveral reſpects, in right and tittle and in the firſt fruits; his very believing puts him in a begun poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of everlaſting life; this is the unknown Art of the Life of Faith, that it fetches its food from far to him that hath it, it brings the firſt fruits of the promiſed Land, to the wanderer in the wilderneſs, a cluſter of Grapes from the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47356:176"/>
brook Eſcol, to the barren deſart; it mounts up with wings as Eagles, to bring down life and quickning to our creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wreſtling motions here below.</p>
            <p>Thus ye have a very brief hint of Faith, of that Faith whereby ye are to live and feed on what is in the Word of Promiſe, though it be not accompliſhed. I ſhall only give you one inſtance of it, which may diſcover to many, how little they know of this Act of living by Faith, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the Promiſe, and feeding on it ere the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance come. The inſtance is that of the Patriarchs, who lived before Chriſts Exhibition in the fleſh, look upon it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>He rejoyced,</hi> or (as the word will bear) <hi>he skipped for joy to ſee Chriſt's day, and he ſaw it, and was glad;</hi> whether he ſaw it in the Promiſes only, or generally in the Sacrifices alſo, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that Providence of the Ram, put in his hand to offer up in ſtead of his Son <hi>Iſaak, Gen.</hi> 22.13. It is all a matter, he got ſuch a ſight of Chriſt in thoſe, and ſo cloſed with the thing Promiſed that he skipped for joy. And the like inſtances we have given of all the Patriarchs in that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. (which may make many bluſh when they read it) <hi>Theſe all</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>died in faith;</hi> They were not content meerly to have a life of Faith, <hi>but they died in faith, not having received the promiſes;</hi> or though they received not the things promiſed. But what did they? <hi>Having ſeen them a far off</hi> (to wit in the Promiſes, and in the Types illuſtrating them) What more? They were perſwaded of them (the firſt thing I ſaid before of Faiths giving a ſubſiſtence to things hoped for; and what more?) They embraced them, they hugged them, and what more? They confeſt <hi>they were pilgrims, or ſtrangers on the earth;</hi> They ſaw as much by Faith in the Promiſes, which were not to be accompliſht in all their lifetime, as made them up, and made them to confeſs <hi>that they were pilgrims here;</hi> Try your ſelves by theſe meaſures, and ſee what ye have won to, like this Faith; believing and putting forth Faith
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47356:177"/>
to exerciſe, feeding on, and fending by Faith in the word of Promiſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to <hi>hoping in his word;</hi> The term in the Text is, <hi>In his word do I hope;</hi> as Faith gives ſubſiſtence to things promiſed, and doth not ſuſpend all benefit and uſe of the Promiſes until they be performed; So hope looks out for the actual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and performance of the Promiſes. A Saint believing the Word, and feeding on that which Faith gives a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to in the word, he looks out by hope for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that which it finds to ſubſiſt in the word.</p>
            <p>I ſhall deduce this as briefly as I can, (and leave this Note and the Verſe) in theſe two, 1. Remember, that true Believers wealth lyes in hope, or things before their hand; They have no exiſtence but in the word of promiſe; The firſt, or at leaſt a very conſpicuous mark of an adopted Child of God is, that he is put to his Hopes; to his Too-looks, and to live that way; he that 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. can ſay, <hi>I am a ſon of God, and it doth not appear what I ſhall be, but when he appears, I ſhall be like him, for I ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> Muſt add in the 3. <hi>verſe, He that hath this hope in him muſt purifie himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. He that according to Gods abundant mercy is begotten again, is <hi>begotten unto a lively hope.</hi> His Regeneration breaths out Hope, becauſe his happineſs is before his hand, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And beſide his too-looks to iſſues here that he holds by hope, his great too-look is his Hope, <hi>which is laid up for him in Heaven, Col.</hi> 1.5. and in that forecited place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He that is begotten again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead;</hi> it is to the hope of an <hi>inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved for him in Heaven;</hi> his great hope is, <hi>the hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began, Tit.</hi> 1.2. His hope is a hope <hi>ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Heb.</hi> 6.18. Now a Believers wealth lies in things before his hand, or the Saints portion lies in their hopes and too-looks, becauſe God is reſerving their happineſs
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47356:177"/>
for the fitteſt place and ſeaſon, he will have them brought where their happineſs is, before he give them the wealth he hath promiſed; becauſe neither could they be capable of it, nor guide it here: and while he ſuſpends their Hope, he does them good by holding them waiting, looking out, and purſuing for theſe things promiſed; a purſuers life being the beſt life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the great portion of the Saints is before their hand, ſo their great work lyes in the exerciſe of Hope; It is not enough for a ſaint <hi>to be begotten again to a lively hope of an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades not away, reſerved for him in heaven;</hi> but he muſt be putting out his Hope to feed upon it, to look and long for it. If ye conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Negatively, what a ſaint is without hope, in reference to temporal iſſues. <hi>David</hi> will tell you in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living;</hi> if my hope had failed me, I had been undone, and in reference to Eternity, <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men the moſt miſerable;</hi> which may be underſtood both of things hoped for, &amp; of the Grace of Hope looking for them; and hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Hope,</hi> is called, <hi>the anchor of the ſoul, ſure and ſtedfaſt, entring into that within the vail,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that if hope be not exerciſed, ſtorms will drive a toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoul, and make it run the hazard of ſhipwrack; but hope, the ſouls anchor, caſt upon good ground, drives not, and preſerves the ſoul from ruine. Hence alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Hope,</hi> is called, <hi>the helmet of ſalvation,</hi> becauſe it is that which keeps off many a deadly ſtroke off a ſaint. The head being the ſeat of the ſenſes, eſpecially of the judgment and memory; If a man keep his head, and a bit about his heart well, there is the leſs hazard of wounds in other places of his body, that they prove deadly. Now Hope is an Helmet to keep the head. And as conſidering Negatively, what a ſaint is without hope, we will find great need of the exerciſe of hope. So look on it poſitively; hope exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47356:178"/>
and kept at work, brings in many noble advantages to the ſoul, as I ſaid of the man that is a Believer, ſo may I ſay of him that is a hoper indeed; O what a made up man is he, he may ſay, <hi>I will wait,</hi> becauſe <hi>I hope in his word;</hi> he is a great gainer by Tribulation, and may glory in it, when <hi>tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not aſhamed, Rom.</hi> 5.3.— Ye have it recommended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. <hi>To rejoyce in hope,</hi> and that will produce patience in tribulation, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing inſtant in Prayer; hope exerciſed, makes patience and prayer to thrive well, and a man to go on in his way, not heartleſly, but rejoycing. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. We are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>hold faſt our confidence, and the rejoycing of hope firm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end:</hi> &amp; what ſhall I ſay of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. who not only ſympathiſed with others in affliction, <hi>but took joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpoiling of their goods;</hi> Why? <hi>knowing in themſelves that they had in heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance,</hi> they had the hope of a better Treaſure.</p>
            <p>From all that hath been ſaid on this, let me exhort you, who have been put, and may yet more be put to it, <hi>To wait for God,</hi> to ſtudy to be better acquaint with your Bibles, to believe the divine Authority of the Scriptures, and on that account, to put forth your Faith and Hope to exerciſe upon the Scriptures, that ye may feed on the Promiſes by Faith, and rejoyce in hope of the accompliſhment of them; that will make you patient in tribulation and to continue inſtant in prayer: And for a cloſe of all that hath been ſaid to you on this matter; would ye know what ye are doing in this exerciſe of Hope, in your waiting for God, or the good things be hath promiſed; or what Characters ye have of it, I ſhall only deſire you to look to theſe three;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Look to Hopes langour, if ye be <hi>waiting for God,</hi> and if your waiting be an affectionat waiting, if your ſoul be waiting and looking out in hope to that great and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat hope of Believers; try what languor is in thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the marriage day, What languor thou haſt to ſee
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47356:178"/>
how the Crown and the Robe will ſet thee, to ſee God as he is, to ſee God incarnat in thy own nature, to ſee the Lamb, and to follow him wherever he goes, and to be made like him. Try what there is of warmneſs of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on longing without fretfulneſs, haſte, or paſſion upon the one hand, and careleſs indifferency and ſtupidity upon the other, that is a good ſign of a lively hope, when thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is keeped warm in waiting for the things promiſed; Art thou ſaved by hope, then with the whole Creation thou wilt be groaning waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of thy body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. —<hi>Thou wilt be looking for, and haſtning unto the coming of the day of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>13.</p>
            <p>And 2 Thou that would look to thy Hope, and have it of the right ſtamp, ſee what purging vertue is in it, look if thy languor reſolves in thy ſtudy of the increaſe of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, that thou mayeſt be ripened and fitted for the iſſue that thou art looking out for, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11 <hi>

There is a Character of a lively hope, a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of true languor, when thy hope bids thee haſte to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen faſt for that thou hopeſt for, that thou may be like <hi>Enoch, walking with God, and who was not, for God took him; Gen.</hi> 5.24. That thy grace may be increaſed, till grace take needfire in glory.</p>
            <p>And 3. Thou that would look to thy hope, ſee what mortification is in thy hope, what thou can ſubmit to want
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47356:179"/>
and be weaned from, upon the account of thy hope; that hath been the practice of Saints in reference to out-gates hereaway, To ſtudy mortification, ſee it in <hi>David,</hi> while enemies ſought his life, and laid ſnares for him, ſpoke miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous things, and imagined devices all the day long; he was as a <hi>deaf man that heard not, and as a dumb man that opened not his mouth,</hi> to all the injuries done or deviſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Why? In the Lord did he hope, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would hear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.12. And in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a mans everlaſting happineſs, this alſo would be his ſtudy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. compare the 3, 4, and 5. <hi>Verſes,</hi> with the 6. <hi>Ye are begotten again unto a lively hope, to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible, undefiled, that fades not away, reſerved in the heaven for you, who are keeped through the power of God to ſalvation, through faith, ready to be revealed in the laſt time; wherein ye greatly rejoyce, though now for a ſeaſon, if need be ye are in heavineſs, through manifold tentations.</hi> In a word, ye that are hopers in God, look well to theſe three, what warmneſs of affection and languor is in your hope, for the things promiſed, look what endeavours are to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fitted for them; and what mortification to the things in time, upon the account of the great happineſs ye expect when time is gone, and your hopes ſhall be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and made out to you.</p>

            <p>I Have now (as ye have heard) gone through ſeveral Heads upon this Branch of the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> wreſtling, and grapling with delays of comfort, or an out-gate, even when he is crying to God under trouble, and making a right uſe of diſcovered ſin, and its ill deſerving, wherein
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47356:179"/>
ſomewhat hath been ſpoken to theſe four; 1. His exerciſe, He is <hi>waiting.</hi> 2. The Object of this his exerciſe, <hi>He waits for the Lord.</hi> 3. His affection in this exerciſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>I come now to the 5. and laſt Head of this wreſtling, contained in the ſixth Verſe, wherein he gives an account of the meaſure of his affection in waiting; He hath ſaid in the preceeding Verſe, <hi>my ſoul waits for the Lord;</hi> and now it does not ſuffice him to repeat that, but will tell what meaſure of affection he had in that waiting, and he ſets it out in compariſon of them <hi>that watch for the morning;</hi> and ſays, that his ſoul waited more inſtantly and affectionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God, than they did for the morning light; Who theſe are that watch for the morning, it is not very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar to determine. It was the lot of Shepherds, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. They watched all night over their flocks; and <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31.40. Tells us, That in <hi>keeping Labans flocks, the drought conſumed him by day, and the froſt by night,</hi> and <hi>his ſleep departed from his eyes;</hi> and theſe ſhepherds, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they had cold and ſtormy nights, would think long for the break of day, the light whereof would be comfortable to them, and refreſh them again; there were Travellers in thoſe deſarts, that bordered on the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who wanted the accommodations of Inns by the way, who were forced to lodge abroad in the fields: and theſe conſidering the uncomfortableneſs of the dark night, eſpecially if ſtormy, and the hazard they were in by <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Thieves and Robbers, they would long for the day light. And beſides, theſe in Wars, they had their Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and Perdeus for watching, and thoſe of them eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whom they ſet neareſt the Enemy, lying neareſt the hazard in the dark night, and being there alone, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Seaſon was ſtormy; How inſtantly and eagerly would they long for the morning light, that they might be
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47356:180"/>
relieved, whether the alluſion be to one or all of theſe, or to ſomewhat elſe, we ſhall not determine. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> fears not to aſſert his Soul in waiting for God, is more earneſt and ardent than any of theſe; <hi>my ſoul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning.</hi> And leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould think he had over-reached in ſo ſaying, he will repeat it, I <hi>ſay more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of this Verſe, having occurred before on theſe words in the preceeding Verſe, <hi>My ſoul doth wait,</hi> where ye heard of the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> affection <hi>in waiting for God,</hi> and how neceſſary and comfortable it is, when the Saints are right, to be able to reflect, and to give an account of what they are doing in trouble; therefore I ſhal paſs it with a few ſhort Notes, partly from what is alluded to here, partly from the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> aſſertion of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to what is alluded to here, of theſe that wanted the nights reſt, or being in hazard, were put to look gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily out, and long for the morning light. I ſhall give you what I would gather from it, in theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ye may here read the hard and bitter toil, with which many of the ſons of men are exerciſed in time, ſo that in the night appointed by God for reſt, they are in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that puts them to long for the morning light, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not ſpeak of theſe, who <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.67. are ſo hard put to it, that in <hi>the morning they wiſh it were even, and at even they wiſh it were morning;</hi> but ſetting that aſide, many of the Children of men are put to very hard and bitter toil, as Soldiers, Travellers through deſarts, Ship-beaten men at Sea in Storms; Shepherds in theſe before-mentioned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, many are ſo toiled, that their great expectation is to look out for an end of it. And what toil are many up and down the Land, and it may be among your ſelves put unto for a preſent throw-bearing, ye know it better than I can lay it before you; I mark it, that others that have an eaſier lot, may be excited to prize that mercy. Diſcontentment is a Viper that ſucks poyſon out of the beſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47356:180"/>
lots that befal the Children of men. How many can ly down and riſe at their conveniency, exempted from the toil and bondage, that the generality of men are expoſed unto; and yet if ye will ſeek for contentment, ye will not readily find it amongſt them that have the beſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, ye wil find men that have but very ſober fare and apparel, and much labour and toil to win at it, for contentment to exceed them that fare deliciouſly and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly, and wear fine apparel, and what is that but a curſe upon them from God for their ingratitude, a plague accompanying them, and what they have; who conſider not what toil others are put unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or their little, and who have contentment in it, and yet they are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their abundance: And much more does it ſpeak ſadly to them, who when God affords them more eaſe and reſt, than he doth others, will not take eaſe, but weary themſelves to commit iniquity, who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave themſelves of reſt, not becauſe they cannot get it, but becauſe they will not take it when it is given them; but either in their imaginations or practice, weary themſelves to commit iniquity, as the word is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this toil, the children of men are put into; I would preſs upon them, who experience this toil, to conſider what a poor bargain they make, when having ſuch toil and labour here, labour not to ſecure that <hi>reſt which abides the people of God.</hi> I confeſs I may ſay to them that have eaſe and good accommodations, that with Heaven and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, is very fair; and I ſhall add, more than conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the Spirit of God hath forwarned us to lay our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>that through much tribulation we muſt enter into the kingdom of God:</hi> But ſhall I lay to poor miſerable bodies, that toil out their life for the bit and the brat (as ye uſe to ſay) That and Hell too is very ſad, That and Everlaſting Perdition is moſt dreadful. There is ſomething to ſay when a rich glutton ſlips from his ſumptuous fare and fine cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, down to the pit, <hi>Son,</hi> (ſays <hi>Abraham) remember that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47356:181"/>
thou in thy lifetime received thy good things, and now thou art tormented.</hi> But for a poor miſerable wretch that time never ſmiled upon, that was pudled in the earth, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver got up his back, in fending for his daily bread, and yet he gets Hell in end, that will be a Hell in the boſome of Hell, that ſuch a wretch underſtood not the language of providence towards him.</p>
            <p>But a 2d word I take from that which is alluded unto here, and that is, That the ſatisfaction of the ſons of men in time, is generally, if not conſtantly before their hand, like theſe poor men alluded to here, what-ever be their lot in the dark night, that which they would be at, is the morning light. I need not aſtrict this to folk that are in toil and miſery; take me the rich fool and his full Barns, it is not that which he hath in his hands at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but his expectation of many years to come, that is his ſatisfaction, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. Be thy felicity what it will, as to earthly enjoyments, conſult thy Conſcience, and it will tell thee, that it doth not ſatisfy, by drinking at theſe Puddles, thou but augments thy thirſt, ſtill thy ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is before thy hand, and in nothing thou poſſeſſes; I mean not now of them that have placed their ſatisfaction in God, but of thoſe that are ſeeking ſatisfaction in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts: Have what thou wilt, it will not ſatisfy, when thou haſt gotten ſuch a thing as thou would have had, thou muſt ſtill have another; and when thou haſt gotten that, thou muſt have more of it: Hence the mind of man, when it is not centered on God, is ſtill luſting and expecting ſatisfaction in this and that, in ſomething it wants. This Note preaches to all ſorts of folk; it's a docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them that are in a mean condition, and think, O were they the length of other folk, and had that which they want, and others have, then they would be well, and at eaſe: But conſider thou, that theſe who have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe things, and have not gotten God with them,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47356:181"/>
never attained to ſatisfaction; and though thou had them, and have not God with them, where art thou for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? thy Straw-Pad, and their Down-Bed, are alike for giving ſatisfaction, and it may be thine, is the ſofteſt of the two; and art not thou a fool then in placing ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe things, when they that have them, are as far from ſatisfaction as thou art; and it may be further; thou art like the Bairn, who thinks, that if he were at the Hill head, he would be at the Sun when it is going down; but when he is at the head of the Hill, he is as far from ſatisfaction as he was; ſo it is with thee who art in a mean condition, and thinks thou would be ſatisfied if thy lot were like others. It may be alſo a document to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented folk, that have (if they conſider) what they would be at, and yet it will not ſatisfy; if they conſider that they are creatures, and things of time, what means theſe diſſatisfactions, diſcontents, and to-looks to many things in the midſt of enjoyments? Certainly upon this hand it's a dreadful Preaching of an unmortified mind. O what a vaſt bottomleſs Gulf is an unmortified mind? It's like Hell and the Grave, that never have enough. And O that many would ſeek out the guilt that is in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, lament their diſcontents, and mourn over their abuſe of rich allowances, the Crumbs whereof would be gathered up as a mercy by many, rather than be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for more, which being had would not ſatisfy. And upon the other hand, it's a Proclamation to all, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is not here; have what thou wilt, project or get what thou wilt, thou wilt drink all theſe puddles dry; ſuppoſe thou had all the profits, pleaſures and preferments in the Univerſe, they will not ſatisfy nor quench thy thirſt after more. Why? God by the vanity of what thou ſeeks after, is proclaiming that thy happineſs is elſewhere. And as I ſaid to them that are put to toil, and kept low, though they had the things that others have, they will
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47356:182"/>
not ſatisfy without God. So I repeat it to them that have many things to enjoy, and have no ſatisfaction in them, and yet will not ſift their minds, to ſee if that be in God which they ſeek and miſs in Creatures, they ſhall never have ſatisfaction that's in him only, which will ſatisfy and hold in thy mind from running out on many things.</p>
            <p>And to preſs this further, I ſhall give you a third word from that which is ſuppoſed here, that is, that change as a man will in time, he will find any change ſtill inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. The weary Shepherds in the night might long for the day, but they behoved not to be careleſs in the day when it came, otherways ſome miſchance might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Flock. Theſe Travellers in thoſe Deſarts, might think the day ſweet, in compariſon of the dark night, and yet they might be ſet on by <hi>Arabian</hi> Robbers in the day, as well as in the night. The Centinel <hi>Pardiu</hi>'s, when they were relieved from off the Watch by night, knew not but they might loſe their life in Battel in the day: So that for as eager as men are for changes in time, change as men will in time, they will find any change they meet with in time ſtill inſignificant; and this is worth our conſideration, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.10. That which hath been is known already to be man. Change as we will, we will not get out of time, and ſo will not be free of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if we ſeek an happineſs in time; let a man ſhift as he will in time, if he carry himſelf with him, he will carry his Croſs with him, he will carry his unmortified mind, though he were in a Paradiſe of Pleaſure, that will create a Croſs to him; Why? He is but ſtill in time, and there will be diſſatisfaction attending any change to that man that ſeeks a happineſs in time. I ſhall ſay no more of this, but were it well ſtudied, it would cut ſhort ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our anxious expectations, it would bring us to that which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.20. (though I will not ſay to <hi>Solomons</hi> ſenſe) that he went about to cauſe his

               </gap>ne hope of ſatisfaction in any change or lot, and diſcover unto him that he will never find it, if it be not in God; and therefore whatever his caſe be, and whatever he do as to duty, to be better, he would labour to find his preſent condition an out-gate; he would think with himſelf it is but time, and change as I will, I may be worſe, and therefore it's my beſt, if I can, to clout up my preſent condition with the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction may be win at, and he that doth ſo hath made a good bargain: Why? Shift as he will while he is in time, he will find Wormood in his Cup, and a Worm at the root of his Gourd, which will marr his ſatisfaction. So much to be gathered from that which is alluded to here.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the next place (having ſpoken to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter on the fifth Verſe, except what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the meaſure of his affection in waiting) give you what the Pſalmiſt propoſes here in three words, and go briefly through them, if the Lord will.</p>
            <p>And 1. See here that the Children of God can never be ſure enough that they have that bleſt meaſure of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and affection in waiting for God, that they are free of paſſion, haſte, bitterneſs, and fretfulneſs upon the one hand, and careleſsneſs, indifferency, and ſtupidity on the other, and yet have their affections engaged, and ſet on that they are waiting for. It is not eaſie, I ſay, to win to this, and folks can never be ſure enough that they are in ſuch a temper, and therefore the Pſalmiſt having ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 5. that he <hi>waits for God,</hi> his <hi>ſoul waits;</hi> he repeats it again in this <hi>verſ.</hi> as a thing that he would be ſure of. The ground of this is, that it's hard to keep off one of theſe extreams I named before, in waiting for God: either a man is ready to turn paſſionate, furious and fretful, or if he fall off that extream, he is ready to give way to loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47356:183"/>
to fall lazy, ſtupid and careleſs. The man that in waiting is not haſty, and yet not careleſs, that is affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and yet not ſtupid, is a rare man; and therefore they that took upon the Saints waiting for God as an eaſie taſk, they that ſleep in, or ſlip in it without difficulty, they would look well to it, that any waiting they have be not a cheat. The Pſalmiſt here finds it needful to look again and again, and make it ſure, that he is waiting.</p>
            <p>A 2d. Note I give you from that propoſed here, that the affection of the patient man in waiting for God, ſhould be in ſome ſort ſuitable to the excellency of the thing he waits for, and ſuitable to his need of it. The Pſalmiſt contents not himſelf, to ſay he is waiting, and that his ſoul is waiting, that his affection in waiting is not aſleep, but he aſſerts, that his affection is ſcrewed up in waiting, ſo that his affection in waiting for God, doth far tranſcend theſe that wait for the morning, and he bides by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and repeats it. Ye know how <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his waiting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.82. <hi>Mine eyes fail for thy word, ſaying, when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> He looks out for God, as one looks out for a perſon that they expect home, while he became bleared and failed, and he looks upon that, as having a pathetick cry to God, ſaying, <hi>O, when wilt thou comfort me?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2. <hi>Behold, as the eyes of ſervants look unto the hands of their Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. How greedily and eagerly theſe ſlaves looked for favour of them whom they ſerved, ſo <hi>our eyes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>wait on the Lord our God, untill he have mercy on us.</hi> I ſay no more of this, but if God be infinitly excellent, and if that which he brings with him be infinitly excellent, above all other objects of out expectation, a creeping affection in waiting for God, is but a proclaimed contempt of God. Thou thinks thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, by making many addreſſes to him; but where is thy ſuitable affection to him, and that which thou waits for from him? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.7. tells thee, <hi>that thou offers pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:47356:183"/>
bread upon his altar, and ſays, his table is contemptible.</hi> A man that waits not for God at all, ſpeaks out what is in his heart, and that he is a beaſt, and worſe than a beaſt; but thou that pretends to wait for God, and haſt no ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection to him in thy waiting, proclaims thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him; thou waits for him, but thou would wait with more affection for the pooreſt triffle thou would be at, or expect: And I ſhall add, that as waiting for God would be with much affection, with affection ſuitable to his excellency, ſo it would be ſuitable to thy need of him, and theſe things thou waits for from him. Thou ſayeſt, <hi>God is thy excellency, Jeruſalem is thy chief joy, the joy of the Lord is thy ſtrength;</hi> but is thy affections ſuitable to thy need of him, and his conſolations? when, if thy comfort be ſuſpended, if thou can win at comfort in any other thing, thou waits not for him and his conſolation.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. I ſhall add, that when affection is indeed aloft for God, there is no hazard, no want of accommodation, that would pinch men ſo ſore, as the want of God will pinch a man that is ſet to enjoy God. The Pſalmiſt, whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is aloft, he <hi>waits more for God, than they that watch for the morning.</hi> I ſhall not dip upon this, it is a mercy not to get leave to ſleep, till folk be out of an ill condition, when folks get no reſt to the ſoles of their feet out of God. And I wiſh them who want him, more diſquietneſs, nor many loiterers have, till they get to their feet, and ſeek for their Husband, and find him, and I wiſh them no ill, while I pray for this to them. And I ſhall add, raiſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for God; Who knows what a prognoſtick it might be of a ſweet and comfortable out-gate; and that ſuch a ſouls ſong ſhould be with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here, <hi>Let Iſrael hope,</hi> &amp;c. Affectionat waiting for God, getting to the feet to run after him; O! What a cloud might that be, like an hand-breadth at firſt, that will cover the Sky, and at length bring abundance of rain? But want of affection
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47356:184"/>
leaves folk in a woful condition, to rot to dead. And I ſhall add, if affection ſhould be put out thus for God, and if want of God to an affectionat waiter be a diſtreſs that pinſheth him above any hazard they are in, who are put to wait for the morning: Then certainly the enjoyment of God, according to the meaſure that a man doth enjoy him ſhould make <hi>him drink and forget his miſery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his poverty no more:</hi> And the man that enjoys God, <hi>Though the fig-tree do not bloſſom and though there be no fruit in the vine, and the labour of the olive fail, no meat in the fields, no flock in the folds, no herd in the ſtall.</hi> Hab. 3.17. <hi>Though the earth be removed, and the mountains carried into the midſt of the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2. He will be as far above the men of the world in their enjoyments, as his affection while he wanted God, was above their reſentments. I ſhall go no further, <hi>God bleſs his word unto you.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>YE may remember in the firſt ſix verſes of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we have the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> wreſtling, which (as we ſhewed you before) hath three Branches; He hath been wreſtling with difficulties, and plunging perplexities in his caſe, which are repreſented under the notion of <hi>depths,</hi> in the firſt and ſecond Verſe, he hath been wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Conſcience, and ſenſe of Guilt, putting back his Prayers, and offering to cruſh his hopes, and ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to obſtruct his ſucceſs and acceſs, <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 4. and in the 5, and 6. he hath been wreſtling with delays, either of comfort, or an out-gate, or both, and (notwithſtanding
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47356:184"/>
of all his hard exerciſe, in crying to God by Prayer in his trouble and perplexity, in taking with the dreadful deſert of guilt, and claiming to pardoning mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) he doth therewith wreſtle by patience and hope. He waited on God, and that affectionatly; and his patience in waiting was ſupported by hope in God, grounded on the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Now in theſe two <hi>verſes</hi> read, ye have the ſecond part of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> containing the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> delivery, or victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; His delivery or victory is not expreſly aſſerted, but it is very ſweetly implyed in his improvement of the exerciſe he hath been under, and holding forth the good he hath gotten; when it is well with him, the iſſue he hath gotten, he doth not conceal it, nor only ſpeak it out, but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and layes it out for the good of God's <hi>Iſrael;</hi> when he hath got a ſweet ſight of the good of waiting and hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, he conveens them all, as it were, to come and write after his Copy, and encourages them to hope in God, upon the account of mercy and pardon, and plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; <hi>and redeeming Iſrael from all his iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the words contain firſt, an Exhortation to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the beginning of the 7. verſe, <hi>Let Iſrael hope</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They contain motives and encouragements, preſſing the exhortation, by way of arguments, that this counſel ſhould be hearkned unto; and theſe motives or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, are taken partly in the firſt place, from what is in God: In the end of the 7. <hi>verſe, Let Iſrael hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for with the Lord there is mercy,</hi> &amp;c. There is mercy and power, and authority in God, to bring redemption to his people from all their ſins and miſeries. And the 2. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is taken from this, that God will let out that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and redemption that is in him, for the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Not only is there mercy and power with God, if he pleaſe to let it out to redeem; but it is expreſly aſſerted, that he will redeem his people, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>He ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities;</hi> a promiſe which howſoever it be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47356:185"/>
made out to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in all ages, yet it is ſignally to be eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Converſion in the latter days; for the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. adduces this promiſe out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.20. <hi>As it is written, there ſhall come out of Zion the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob;</hi> That is, that ſhall redeem Iſrael (as was hinted) from all his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
            <p>To return to the Exhortation, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord;</hi> I have been (would he ſay) aſſaying to hope in the Lord, and have found the good of it, for when I was waiting for God, I was ſupported by hope in his Word, and now I have gotten ſo good an account of my hope, that I dare recommend it from mine own experience to all, and I have ſuch a kindneſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that any experience I have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by waiting for God, and hoping in his Word; I will not hoord it up, I will be no hookſter of it, but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to them as a common-good; Therefore <hi>let Iſrael hope in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may get ſomewhat digged out of the Treaſure here, I ſhall reduce the grounds of Obſervations to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from this Exhortation, to four general Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I</hi> ſhall touch upon what is implyed, and held out in the general ſcope of theſe words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſpeak to the Duty recommended, and that is, <hi>Hope in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall remark ſomewhat on the Recommender of this duty; it is the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> who had been trying Hope, and had found the good of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhall add ſomewhat by way of reflection, on theſe to whom this Duty is recommended, <hi>Let Iſrael hope;</hi> it is the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, among whom (as the word is, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2.) there is hope concerning caſes and lots, otherwayes hopeleſs and deſperat.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For what is implyed, and is the general ſcope of this Exhortation; I ſhall (the Lord willing) deduce theſe two from it: 1. That the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is here delivered, and is a
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47356:185"/>
victor, or hath goten ſome good account of his former wreſtling, waiting for God, and hoping in his word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the good account he hath gotten, he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats his experience of it to the People of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, it is clear here, that if the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> has not been actually delivered from all his preſſures; yet he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo comfortable an account of his hoping in God, that he dare from his experience recommend it to others to hope in him; he bears witneſs of the great good to be reaped by hoping in God. The Obſervation then is, That there will be a bleſt account of all the exerciſes of the Saints, and particularly of their waiting for God, and hoping in his Word. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> eſſayed it here, and is able to give a good account of it. This Point imports in the firſt place, That real needy Saints have many errands to God, they are never out of his miſter, and holden going to him, which is a very enriching Trade, though it be not always pleaſing and ſatisfying to their fleſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſuppoſes this, that as they have much ado with God, ſo they are very earneſt, till they get a good account of what ever it be they are waiting for from him, they are not ſuch as can cry out of the depths, and be indifferent, whether they get a hearing, fall aſleep, or turn ſtupid, but their preſſures ly ſo ſore upon them, that they cannot be laid by and worn out with time, but they muſt have acceſs, and a good account of their ſuits.</p>
            <p>And 3. As the point ſuppoſes theſe two; ſo it propoſeth that there will be a good account gotten of all their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and particularly of their waiting for God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in his Word, their exerciſes are not loſt labour; The Lord bids them <hi>open their mouth wide, and he will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81.10. When he bids his people ſeek him, he can appeal to malice it ſelf, to inſtruct, if ever he bade them ſeek him in vain, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.19. If he put poor <hi>Job</hi> to exerciſe patience, he will make the world ſee the end of the Lord, that he is very pitiful, and of tender mercy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. He hath made it
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:47356:186"/>
out in the manifold experience of all his Saints, that that ſong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.8. <hi>ult.</hi> Was and is ſtill abiding them, <hi>verily there is a reward for the righteous, a God that judges in the earth.</hi> I might prove it further from the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> wherein what ever ſad exerciſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> has been put unto, in the beginning or progreſs of theſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> for the moſt part they all cloſe comfortably with ſome ſweet word, intimating an iſſue and victory. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ye find <hi>Heman Pſal.</hi> 88. Cloſing ſadly, yet ye will find him. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.30, Put in among theſe great wits, and underſtanding perſons in his time.</p>
            <p>But leaving all theſe, I ſhall give you theſe three words of Confirmation of this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>And 1. <hi>I</hi> ſay, they are all living that died in waiting on God, and hoping in his word; I dare not ſay, that they were not affrighted, or that they were not humbled, but they are living that died in that way of waiting on him. Gather all Believers together, that have been from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, ye will not find among them all, a Saint that has periſhed in this attempt, in waiting for God by Faith and Hope.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the ſaints have been affrighted, and humbled, yet many a bleſt diſappointment have exerciſed ſaints met with, and will meet with of their fears and perplexing thoughts. It is no ſtrange thing to hear the waiting man ſay, <hi>I am cut off;</hi> and yet meeting with a bleſt beguile, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid, I am cut off from before thine eyes, nevertheleſs thou heardeſt the voice of my ſupplication,</hi> &amp;c. The anſwer of my prayers, gave ſenſe and ſuggeſtion the lie. Nay, it is no wonder that fleſh tempted, tempt the waiting man, to ſay, <hi>all men are liars.</hi> So ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 116.11. But ſee and hear him, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>What ſhal I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me.</hi> Behold a man caſting the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and all the Promiſes at the one bout, and at the next, nonpluſs'd with a burden of benefits and mercies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſay this, that though exerciſed ſaints, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47356:186"/>
on God have eſſayed, and may eſſay many means in vain, as to any preſent ſucceſs, yet that proves not their caſe to be hopeleſs. The Bride, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. Seeks her beloved on the bed, in the ſtreets, and broad-ways, and at the watch-men, in all the means, and finds him not; yet when ſhe went a little further, ſhe found him. Though the waiter for God hath aſſayed all the means, without ſenſible ſucceſs, he is not to tine hope for all that, but to eſſay them again, we may find that in the ſecond eſſay, which we found not in the firſt.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Uſe,</hi> If it be ſo then, that there will be a bleſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the exerciſes of Saints, and particularly of their waiting for God; I would enquire, who they are among you. 1. Who have any thing of this account to bring forth to God's commendation? There may be a woful genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taking up that deſperat Note, that ye have <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14, 15. Who ſay, <hi>it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully,</hi> &amp;c. And like theſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.3. Who ſay, <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? and wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul?</hi> &amp;c. But haſt thou any thing to ſay for God, to refute that? Can thou ſay, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> to wait upon him, <hi>I</hi> have not ſought him in vain; let the ſong fall on whoſe ſide it will, it ſhall not fall on my ſide, I will keep it up to his commendation, <hi>I</hi> will ſing, and ſay, that his Name endures for ever; I was brought low, and he helped me, I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.4, 6. Bleſſed are they who have ſo good a report to bring upon God; who can bear witneſs for him, to ſhew that the Lord is upright, He is their Rock, and there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.15. But 2. Thou that haſt not found this, thou art waiting on God in the uſe of the means; but thou haſt little to ſay to the commendation of God, of hoping in him; will thou believe that there ſhall be a good account of all thy exerciſe in waiting, believe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47356:187"/>
that thou ſhall not for ever return aſhamed, that there will be an end of the Lord, and a good end, that thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall not periſh for ever, that though thou be laid in the grave with cruſhing, thy dead men ſhall live, there ſhall be an end, and thy expectation ſhall not be cut off; take the exhortation, that word to <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.45. <hi>Bleſsed is ſhe that believes,</hi> for there ſhall be a performance of theſe things, which were told her from the Lord. Thou that art running to God, and waiting on him, for an iſſue of thy preſſures, and ſees no appearance of the day breaking, but rather that the night groweth darker, do not think that it will be ay ſo. Do not follow out thy work and task, as a hopeleſs undertaking; follow not Chriſt as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, to die with him, but ſow in hope; expect that he that hath opened thy mouth wide will fill it, and not with an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſpoon, only do not miſtake while thou art holden at work; needful exerciſe is ſtill requiſit, which will come in afterward, when I ſpeak to the exerciſe of Faith and Hope; and therefore here I ſhall leave it, and proceed to the next thing which I marked, as implyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Pſalmiſt hath got a breathing, and good account of his hope, he is very communicative of it, he poures it out in <hi>Iſraels</hi> boſom: That which I mark from it is, That the exerciſes and out-gates of the Saints, when they are bleſſed of God to them, they make them very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick minded; when the Lord drops out any good thing to them, they would fain deal about them, for the good of Gods people, and make many ſharers in it. Ye know there is a Communion of Saints, it is an Article of our Creed, it is a communion and entercourſe, ſuch as is betwixt the members of the body, that when one member ſuffers, all the members ſuffer with it, and when one rejoyceth, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with it; What one hath, is (at leaſt ſhould be) communicat for the good of the reſt, and of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and I might add, it is a ſad thing when the duties of the communion of Saints muſt be looked on as a crime,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47356:187"/>
and tranſgreſſion: But that which I am now upon is, That this communion of Saints will be improved by all, who are lively, and who are bleſſed of God, in their exerciſes and out-gates, as we may ſee the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> here, what good he hath gotten by waiting on God, he communicats it to <hi>Iſrael. I</hi> may confirm this two ways, 1. We find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when the people of God are in trouble themſelves, they are never ſo throng about their own caſe, or ſo taken up with themſelves, but they have ſpare time for the caſe of the Church, or others who are in the ſame or like exerciſe; If our bleſſed Lord ſuffered being tempted, that he might ſuccour them who are tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. Then the ſaints when they are under tentation, preſſures and hard exerciſe, will find that to be a call to them, to have a large and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart towards others, under the ſame exerciſe; yea to bring in the preſſures of all that are about them, as ye may ſee in that holy man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. what a hard exerciſe he is under, from the beginning of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> to <hi>verſe</hi> 12, 13, and 14. — Ye will find the bleſſed improvement of this I am upon, thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come, for thy ſervants take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favour the duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All that he hath to do within doors, though his days be conſumed like ſmoke, his bons brunt as an hearth, his heart ſmitten and withered as graſs, his bones cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Skin; though he be like a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lican in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and an owl in the deſart (as in that 102 <hi>Pſalm</hi>) yet all that hinders him not to cry, <hi>That God would ariſe and have mercy upon Sion,</hi> but rather excites him.</p>
            <p>And a 2d Confirmation of the Point, I take from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Precepts and examples, that preſs us to communicat what good we get of God, to others for their good, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. When Chriſt hath told <hi>Peter</hi> of his fall and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, he ſubjoyns to that: <hi>When thou art converted, ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy brethren:</hi> And whoſo will read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. and the Verſes following. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. — They will find, that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47356:188"/>
the Pſalmiſt, when ever he hath gotten a proof of Gods goodneſs to himſelf, he is very careful to communicat it to others, in direction, inſtruction, encouragement, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, according as God hath communicat it to him; I ſhall ſay no more from this, but let it condemn the ſelfiſh Diſpoſition of many, who being in trouble, the whole ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil of their Spirit is little enough for themſelves, and they have no inlet for the griefs and preſſures of others, and if it be well with them, if they be delivered, they are far from remembring <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Priſon: They do not endeavour this publick-mindedneſs, to communicat their experience for others good; ſuch ſelfiſh frames provock God to give folk humbling exerciſes, to learn them to be publick min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now I have done with the firſt general Head of the Doctrine, implyed in the Exhortation, Let <hi>Iſrael hope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I proceed in the 2d place, to the matter of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the Duty recommended, that is, <hi>to hope in the Lord,</hi> to exerciſe Faith and hope in God; of this, ye may remember, I have been ſpeaking at ſome length upon the 5. verſe before, which may ſave me a labour of inſiſting much on it now. But this of Faith and Hope being a work and task of the people of God, while they are in time, there can never be too much ſaid to it. Therefore I ſhall offer to you two grounds of Obſervation, which I ſhall take from the Pſalmiſts recommending of it to the people of God here over again.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His Exhortation implys the conſtant need, that the Saints will have of Faith and Hope in time.</item>
               <item>2. That the Saints have a conſtant warrand of Hoping, and Believing in God.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, though the Pſalmiſt (as would appear) hath gotten a good account of his hope, yea, for all the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues he hath gotten before; and that the ſaints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in that generation, and before, had gotten of Faith and Hope, they had truſted in God, and He had delivered them from all their fears, and they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47356:188"/>
yet ſtill he preſſes Faith and Hope, as that which the Saints will ſtill have need of, and wherein their life conſiſts. The Obſervation then is plain, That Faith and Hope are Graces whereof the Saints will conſtantly ſtand in need, what-ever deliveries or iſſues they get in time. As here it is ſuppoſed the Pſalmiſt hath gotten an iſſue, yet he will not have Faith and Hope out of requeſt, with him, ſelf and others of the Lords people. Ye know it is ſaid. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>That here we walk by faith, not by ſight;</hi> we muſt always have to do with the graces of Faith and Hope, as long as we live. In all the times of our life they will never be uſeleſs, nor out of faſhion, and conſequently theſe graces ſhould never be out of eſteem with us.</p>
            <p>To deduce the conſtant need that we have of Faith and Hope, and ſo the conſtant obligation that lyes upon us to eſteem of them, I ſhall branch the point in five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, that whenever the people of God get any good account of their Faith and Hope in God, when they attain to any proofs of his help by Faith and Hope; then without all peradventure they are engaged to praiſe God, and will have an high eſteem of theſe graces. It's no ſmall part of God's praiſe, when he hath done his people a good turn, to ſpeak it out to the commendation of God, as the Pſalmiſt doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſhield, my heart truſted in him, and I am helped:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him:</hi> And with that Meſſenger to <hi>Mary, Bleſſed is ſhe that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> If all the proofs of kindneſs that folks get by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith and Hope, were well improved, it would be no ſmall part of their improvement, to cry up to Gods praiſe, theſe noble graces of Faith and Hope in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that even when the Saints are put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Faith and Hope in him in trouble; more Faith and Hope, to believe more, and hope more, is, and will
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47356:189"/>
be found an out-gate and delivery in its own kind: To love the way of believing and hoping in God better, is no ſmall part of an out-gate. Thou it may be miſtakes the ſucceſs of thy endeavours, thou cryes to God from under thy preſſures, and thou hopes in God, yet thou ſees no out-gate; but art thou helped to believe and hope on? There thou haſt an out-gate till more come. If thou do not weary to believe, if thy Anchor of Hope be not come home, but keeps ground. And I ſhall add, were thou falling more in love with Faith and Hope, thou were more delivered. When a man goes to God under his preſſures, and puts Faith and Hope in exerciſe, and comes away content to believe and hope on till delivery come, he gets a double anſwer of his Prayer, and when he goes to God again, and comes away with a greater love to Faith and Hope, he is yet more delivered, though he get not an out-gate. It's like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Meal, in the ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he walked 40 days, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. And that was an out-gate, when Chriſt ſaid to the poor woman, <hi>Luk</hi> 8.50. <hi>Fear not, only believe, and ſhe ſhall be made whole.</hi> So when <hi>David</hi> can ſay, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 56.3. <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee.</hi> He is a ſaved man, for all the fears and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that aſſaulted him, that's all a matter, he hath an out-gate. So long as he can truſt in God, he will not fear what fleſh can do unto him. So ye ſee there will be a conſtant need of Faith and Hope to the Saints, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obligation lyes on them to eſteem of them as a Plank to carry them to the Shore, and as an out-gate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Several other things would be touched, for the clearing of this, which I remit to the Afternoon.</p>

            <p>FRom what is ſuppoſed in this Exhortation, and from the general ſcope thereof already ye have heard part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there will be a good account of all the exerciſes of the Saints, particularly of waiting on God; and partly, that it is an evidence of bleſſed exerciſes and iſſues, when the Saints are publick-minded, and communicative of what is betwixt God and them, for the edification and good of others. I came in the morning to ſpeak to the ſecond Head of Doctrine, to be gathered from this Exhortation, that is the duty recommended, <hi>to hope in the Lord.</hi> From which (without any large repetition) I propoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce two Notes. The firſt on which I brake in, was, That Faith and Hope are Graces that the Saints will conſtantly need, and which therefore they will conſtantly eſteem of, or at leaſt ſhould prize highly, for all the iſſues the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt himſelf, or the people of God, before or in the preſent Generation had gotten, he will have Faith and Hope in God looked on as conſtantly neceſſary. I deduced this firſt, in ſhewing how, many proofs of Gods help, attained to by Faith and Hope, ſhould be an engagement to praiſe God, by highly commending of theſe Graces. And 2. By ſhewing, that in the greateſt preſſures of Gods people, to get grace to believe more, is a bleſſed out-gate.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to deduce the Point further; and in the third place, this preſſes the conſtant neceſſity of Faith and Hope, and our obligation to eſteem of them, that no iſſues, no deliveries or out-gates warrands us to lay them by, as if we had no more need of them. It is true (as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) Love is the great Grace, becauſe of the longeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47356:190"/>
and Faith and Hope will be laid by in the next life, as to the way of exerciſing them now, but that ſays not, that they will ever be unneceſſar to us, while we are here upon earth. <hi>David</hi> took a wrong meaſure, when <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6. <hi>He ſaid in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, he ſhould never be moved:</hi> Therefore when God hid his face, he was troubled. When the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious iſſues to be had here-away, are afforded, the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and hoper in God muſt make for new ſtorms, when he hath gotten a Harbour, he muſt look upon it but as a Creek, to take in new refreſhment, and he muſt weigh Anchor, and make to Sea again, and exerciſe his Faith and Hope.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we conſider the relation that Faith and Hope have to Duty, it will diſcover the conſtant need that we have of them, and conſequently the eſteem that we ſhould have of them. The Fountain of all acceptable doing of duty is, by abiding in Chriſt, by abiding in him we bring forth fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. and we abide in him by Faith. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all our doing duty, is Faith and Hope; Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>We both labour, and ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, becauſe we trust in the living God.</hi> Would a man have his heart purged from pollutions? <hi>It's faith that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the heart,</hi> Acts 15.9. Would a man go about any duty in Religion? he muſt draw his Furniture out of Chriſt by Faith. To go about duty with diſcouragement, is the way not only to render duty unacceptable, but to cut the throat of it: Not only a man muſt make uſe of Faith for furniture to do duty, but when duty is gone about, he hath work for Faith to renew his ſtrength to continue in it; and when he hath done his duty, and hath denyed himſelf, and in his beſt performances is humbled for the iniquity of his holy things, he hath need of Faith to ſit down under Chriſts ſhadow, to put it up in his hand, and to cloſe with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47356:190"/>
righteouſneſs. Thus ye ſee what need there is of Faith and Hope, in reſpect of the relation they have to duty.</p>
            <p>And 5. There is conſtant need of Faith in relation to Senſe, and manifeſtations of comfort and love. A man that wants Senſe, and would be at it, the only right way is by believing, that he may ſee, by believing, that he may <hi>rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Believing, that he may be <hi>ſealed with the holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> Eph. 1.13. And when a man is win up to believing, and finds no ſenſible comfort, it's no call to caſt away his Faith, but he muſt cheriſh his Faith more, and yet more, till God be pleaſed to ſend Senſe: He muſt ſtill hold the grip of Faith, if he would have ſenſible manifeſtations flowing out rightly and ſolidly to him: Again when he hath gotten Senſe, he hath need of Faith ſtill to try Senſe, when he doubts of his comfort, whether it be a deluſion or not, and whether it be of God, or a lie in his right hand; it is by Faith, and the rule of Faith, by which he muſt examine and try that: So that when he is hugged in his Fathers boſome, there is need of Faith, walking by its rule, to aſſure him that he is not deluded. And yet further, when he hath gotten Senſe, and tryed it by the rule of Faith, he hath need of Faith ſtill; he muſt not obſerve <hi>Peters</hi> way, while he was on the Mount with Chriſt, <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is good to be here, if thou wilt, let us make three tabernacles,</hi> Mat. 17.4. But he muſt lay his account to come down again, he muſt not reckon, now I ſee, and it will never be dark again, now I have peace, and I ſhall have no more perplexity; but after a Sun-blink, he muſt come down from the Mount of ſenſible enjoyment, and meet with deſertion; and when he hath ſenſible manifeſtations, he muſt lay them at his Maſters feet, and be content to return to the Trade of Believing; Even as the Bride, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.17. when there hath been
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47356:191"/>
much fair Weather betwixt the beloved and her; what ſays ſhe, <hi>Until the day break and the ſhadows flee away, turn my beloved,</hi> as if ſhe had ſaid, I look not upon this as my ordinary allowance within time, the day is not broken in time; The ſhadows are not fled away as yet, therefore I will ſubmit to it, that thou turn or flee, that thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, only on this condition, that when I need, thou wilt come ſwiftly unto me <hi>like a roe, or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether,</hi> or diviſion.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee how in all caſes and lots, there is conſtant need of Faith and Hope, and that there ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant eſteem of theſe Graces; all that I ſhall ſay from it by way of inference, ſhall be in the firſt place, to preſs you to ſtudy this neceſſity well, that ye may not miſtake, that ye may not be ſurprized, what ever ye may meet with, if ye have Faith and Hope, God will not let it ruſt, he will give you clouds to ſee thorow, dark nights of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to grapple with. And once fix your ſelf in the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the conſtant uſefulneſs and neceſſity of Faith and Hope, and it will help to break many ſnares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and particularly your fretting and petting, and the caſting away of your confidence. Let Faith be your one thing. O how cruel are they to themſelves, that weaken their confidence, and caſt away their eſteem of Faith and Hope? They conſider not the conſtant neceſſity of theſe Graces.</p>
            <p>And 2dly. Particularly I would recommend to you, that (as I hinted in the forenoon) ye would take, grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for an out gate. Do never complain that ye are ill-guided, ſo long as Faith keeps the Feet; that were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ſobriety becoming a Chriſtian Spirit, That whatever means for an iſſue be uſed, that it be a mans ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to get grace to judge well of God, and of all his dealing; <hi>Paul</hi> counted it a great favour, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>That having received mercy, he fainted not;</hi> if folk knew what a woful life, want of delivery and iſſue joyned with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47356:191"/>
makes, they would think them delivered folk, who get grace to believe, whoſe faith is not brangled; or though it be brangled, yet it is not put off the field. Ye that have advanced to believing, bleſs God for it, and follow it as your chiefeſt mercy.</p>
            <p>And 3. I ſhall add as a conſequence of what <hi>I</hi> had in the Explication of the Point, that ye would learn to hold a looſe grip of all things that come to give Faith relief, when either ye meet with a temporary delivery from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, or with a ſun-blink of Conſolation coming to Faith as its poſt, and ſaying, ſit down and reſt you a while, hold a looſe grip of the one, and the other. It is but a fair blink in a Winter ſtormy day, and it will overcaſt again; Remember when ye have drawn your breath a little, ye muſt up, and make to your Faith and hope again, when ye have ſeen your Sun, he muſt be overclouded, and ye muſt wait on the Lord, who hides his Face from the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and through the clouds ye muſt look for him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.17. And therefore, as ye would not caſt your Sun-blinks, becauſe they are not laſty (as many do) ſo ye muſt take heed, ye ſit not down upon them, like a tir'd body, ſet down to reſt him, he ſits not long, leaſt he grow ſtiff; The ſober mind is a fixt mind, he feeds with an eye to his journey, he takes his comfort, with an eye to the ſight, wherein he knows not how ſoon he may be engaged. So much for the firſt Note on the ſecond general Head of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Saints will have conſtant need of Faith and Hope, and therefore ſhould highly eſteem of them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That if Faith and Hope be conſtantly neceſſary, then there is need for a conſtant warrand for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and hoping in God; Now what is my warrand, the Pſalmiſts Exhortation to hope in the Lord, imports the conſtant will of God, concerning this, as a duty, even a conſtant warrand to believe and hope, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of time, lot, perſon, or condition, <hi>Let Iſrael hope,</hi> &amp;c. The Obſervation then is clear, That it is allowed to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47356:192"/>
the Saints at all times to believe and hope in God, at all times, whatever their lot or caſe be, or ſeem to ſay, there is no time wherein this duty wears out of faſhion, or the Command enjoyning it, wears out of date; whatever times paſs over them, or lots they fall under; it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant duty, and it is a ſin to neglect it; If ye ſpeak of Faith, for perſonal reconciliation, and the influence it hath on Duty, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is the commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> if ye reſpect Faith, as it is exerciſed about the various lots and times, that paſs over Gods people; it is a commanded duty at all times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times;</hi> there is no time wherein ye are diſpenſed with, not to truſt in him; yea, even theſe times wherein ye will need God for a refuge, and if I might inſiſt, I would let you ſee how Faith is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty in the moſt deſperat conditions and lots, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 46.1, 2, 3. <hi>God is our refuge, a very preſent help in time of trouble, Therefore we will not fear though the earth be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and though the mountains he carried into the midſt of the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. The Believer in God thinks himſelf in a ſurer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, than the courſe of nature: The World may turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, but the Believer is then ſure, having God for a refuge and a preſent help <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Though the fig-tree do not bloſsom, though no fruit be in the vine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. yet he finds warrand to believe, <hi>I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation,</hi> a fruit of Faith. Many would have been ready to ſay. What ſhould <hi>I</hi> do believing? if the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al had come half that length, but come what will come, he finds ground to believe, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. A man comes to Chriſt with his ſick daughter, and ſhe is a dead daughter, ere he come to the houſe, and they ſay, <hi>thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Maſter.</hi> But what ſays Chriſt, verſe 50. <hi>Fear not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve only,</hi> Faith hath a warrand, when trouble goes from ſickneſs to death, not to fear, but only to believe; <hi>David</hi> was tryed with formidable things, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. Yet that takes not away his warrand to believe; Therefore verſe 3.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47356:192"/>
He ſays, <hi>what time</hi> I <hi>am afraid,</hi> I <hi>will truſt in thee;</hi> my fear ſhall feed my confidence, and not drive me from it. Look on him again as a man, whoſe troubles and fears had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and run down; yet he looks not on himſelf as a man, that might quit Faith for all that, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 61.2. When I am at the ends of the Earth, ſays he, when my heart is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, when I have perplexity like to make me ſwoun, when I am ſurcharged and laid by with them; yet from the ends of the Earth I will cry unto thee, (an act of Faith) when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the Rock that is higher than I; my heart and my fleſh failing, ſhall not warrand me to caſt away my confidence, and the Acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting thereon; and <hi>Job</hi> 3.5.14. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſays to <hi>Job, Although thou ſayeſt, thou ſhalt not ſee him, yet Judgment is before him;</hi> Therefore truſt thou in him, and that was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, who againſt hope, believed in hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. when he could ſee no probability of the thing promiſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is in that caſe, in that Paroxiſm, the Believer is to truſt in God; ſo ye ſee the Point is clear, that Faith is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Saints at all times, in all conditions; and Faith hath ſtill a warrand, to put forth it ſelf to exerciſe. The rich good will of God, the immutability of God and his promiſe, bottoms Faith in all times &amp; conditions; it was a good word that <hi>David</hi> had, when the ſycophant <hi>Doeg</hi> came and told <hi>Saul</hi> of his coming to the houſe of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> and flew fourſcore five of the Prieſts; Why boaſteſt thou in miſchief, O mighty man, the goodneſs of God endureth continually; and ſeing it is ſo, Faith hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ground to go upon.</p>
            <p>For Uſe, <hi>I</hi> would give you theſe three words from it, The firſt ſhall be to repreſent this as a mercy. 2. To preſs upon this ground conſtant believing and hoping in God, as a duty. And 3. To ſpeak a word to them that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe they cannot get this Command conſtantly obeyed.</p>

&amp; hope in God at all times, though I fear, I have but few to ſpeak to on this ſcore, few would ever venture an hair of their head on Faith, or on God, if they could get any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fend, ſo long as they could have any ſinful ſhift ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of hell, (<hi>I</hi> had almoſt ſaid in hell) it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſpeak to them of Faith; But are there any of you ſenſible of the ill of Unbelief, that when ye would ſit down and take a lift of your ſelf, or of your condition, or of any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is dear to you, your unbelief and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is like to break you; the diſcouragement of ſome, through the prevailing power of Unbelief, is ſo great, that they turn like dyvors, they dare as ſoon look on hell, as on all the perplexities that are in their caſe; <hi>I</hi> would ſay to ſuch, does thou in this caſe reſent it as a mercy, that thou knows it is thy duty to believe, and a ſin to give way to diſcouragement and unbelief: O bleſs God, thou may venture on Faith, which if thou had not, it is ſad to think, what thou would do next; <hi>I</hi> am now ſpeaking to them that have any thing to do betwixt God and their ſouls, though I fear there be few that have ado with what <hi>I</hi> am now upon; And O that <hi>I</hi> could lament over you, and that ye could lament over your ſelves! But are there any of you preſſed with your ſouls condition, and yet ye are too fool hardy in venturing upon unbelief and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: One of two, either ye have never tryed theſe deep foords of diſcouragement and unbelief; or otherways ye are under a dreadful tentation; for of all the mercies next unto Chriſt, a ſoul that is cruſht with diſcouragement and unbelief, will think this the greateſt mercy, that it hath a warrand to believe; and if ye could bleſs him for that, who knows what it would produce? if ye would bleſs him, that ye know, ye have a command to believe, and that it is a ſin to miſbelieve, and give way to diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But 2. If it be a conſtant commanded duty to believe and hope, will ye conſtantly obey that command? <hi>Truſt
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47356:193"/>
in him at all times;</hi> Whatever ye read in your caſes or lots, or in the times, read this, never to caſt away your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but to believe and hope in God. Thou will ſay, I have few motives to it; but on what account does thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear murther or theft, or any other groſs ſin? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wants temptations to them, or becauſe God hath forbidden them? and haſt thou not a command for believing? Thou muſt not abſtain believing, till thy faith be budded; but becauſe he has commanded, fall about it; Thou thinks thy Faith little worth, it is a blind gueſs, like the blind mans gropping for the wall. But ſhall I ſay. Faith in obedience to a Command, believing with the judgment againſt the ſtream of thy own inclination, is more acceptable to God, than if in thy believing, thou were ſailing before the wind; ye will ſay, ye preſs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand conſtantly to believe, but what ſhould I believe? I have no work for Faith but I have work enough for Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſtruſt; I cannot ſtay now to deduce the Anſwer to this in particular inſtances, relating to ſeveral caſes and times: but (as I marked before on this ſubject) there are general foundations that cannot be moved, Catholick Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials for every condition, and labour to believe theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when thou cannot dip on particulars: As 1. Believe at all times, and in all conditions, that thou art in God's hand, Remember that word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.27. <hi>It is I be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,</hi> believe that all the world cannot pull thee out of his hand; thou mayeſt think thou art in frem'd handling, A meſſenger of Satan is ſent to buffet thee, a wicked man is ſent to oppreſs thee, but believe thou art ſtill in Gods hand. 2. Believe, that as thou art in God's hand, ſo he in whoſe hand thou art, doth all things well, that is his Motto in all his dealing, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.37. And he will not begin at thee, to give beguile to Truſters in him. 3. Believe, <hi>that his thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither, are his ways as your ways, Iſai.</hi> 55.8. And therefore although thou can ſee no outgate, yet he ſees it, and the way how to bring it about,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47356:194"/>
and let him take his own way, and do not limit him to thy model. 4 Believe that he hath wiſdom, power &amp; love, that thou may venture thy all upon, and that it cannot be ſo well, as when thou ventures it upon theſe. 5. Believe that he is God and not man, thou would have out-wearied the patience of men and angels, having had to do with them, but he is God and not man, with whom thou haſt to do. 6. Believe that all that he ſaith or doth to his people, or thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver ſays, go a way. The ſcope of all, the ſound of all, he does or ſays, <hi>is come, and go not away;</hi> deſertions, tryals, ſcourges, or whatever elſe he ſends, ſays, come. 7. Believe, that many a diſappointment will he give to thy falſe and deceitful heart, when thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Wilt thou caſt off for ever? will he be favourable no more? is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fail for evermore? hath he forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies?</hi> He will give theſe thoughts the lie, and make thee re-cant, and eat in that language with ſhame and repentance, and believe this, and ſay, I am treaſuring up matter of repentance and mourning for my ſelf, when God comes and calls me to an account for ſuch thoughts of him. 8. Believe, that God is concerned in thee and his people and intereſt, more than thou art, his ſtake is greater than thine; art thou come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? Thou art given to him and he will count for thee, and every one of his people; <hi>He that touches them, touches the apple of his eye.</hi> And remember that argument <hi>Joſhua</hi> hath, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.9. <hi>What wilt thou do unto thy great Name?</hi> Believe that, and it will put thy mind to reſt; theſe are foundations, and Catholick Cordials, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt truſt to at all times, and make uſe of in all caſes, when thou knows not how to put forth Faith, as to particulars; And O! what ſweet Cordials will flow out of them, for Faith and Hope to feed upon, in the darkeſt of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But 3. If time would permit, a word would be ſpoken
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47356:194"/>
to them, that are troubled, becauſe they cannot get this Command of believing and hoping in God, conſtantly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. Thou art convinced it is a commanded Duty, but thou cannot win at it; Unbelief makes a ſlave of thee, when thou would comfort thy ſelf againſt ſorrow, thy heart is faint within thee, thou would look through the Cloud, but thine Eyes are dim, that thou cannot ſee through it; thou that art ſo overpowered with Unbelief, look that it be thy weakneſs and not thy wilfulneſs; How ſhall I evidence that, will thou ſay? Here is a proof of it, mourn over that which thou cannot overcome; thou art overpowered with Unbelief, and cannot help it come, and ſit down before God, and cry, violence is done thee. Tentation and Unbelief prevails with thee, and thou cannot maſter them, but they overcome thee: lament that to God; if thou debate with Unbelief, it will turn like a Snow Ball, that grows the more, the more it be rolled; but mourning over it to God, is the beſt way to get it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome: I thought to have deduced this at more length; and ſhewed you, it is an evidence of a bleſſed frame, to be mourning for Goſpel ſins, as well as for ſins againſt the Law; but the day being ſhort, <hi>I</hi> ſhall detain you no longer. <hi>God bleſs what ye have heard.</hi>

an hour of temptation, may be lookt on as a very great folly, and a poor ſhift for a man to betake himſelf unto, and a man may then be tempted to caſt them away; but when men have tryed them well, they will ſee cauſe to revock all the miſconſtructions that they had of Faith and Hope, and to commend them from the rich advantage they have found in them, if ye will conſider <hi>David,</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent example and pattern of believing, and hoping in God, ye will find theſe three in him; one is, that he was as much put to it as any, to live the life of faith; ye will find, that ſometimes there is nothing betwixt him and fainting, and over-giving, but believing; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. I <hi>had fainted, unleſs I had believed,</hi> &amp;c. Ye will find that he had nothing for a caſten-down ſoul, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within, but hoping in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.43. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that as ye find him often put to it, to live by faith and hope. So ye will find him now and then under a temptation, that he was at the next beſt under this ſhift, and tempted to quite it. How often is he put to that of the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18, <hi>I ſaid, my hope and my ſtrength is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, all men are liars.</hi> Behold what a ſad conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in this caſe, and what a low opinion he hath of faith and hope in an hour of temptation. But in the third place, take him again at the turn of the Tide (as ye uſe to ſpeak) ye will find him in another tune, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116 10. <hi>I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore have I spoken:</hi> Not only eſteeming of faith for his own uſe, but a man that dare commend it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait, I ſay, on the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I ſhall draw from this Head, ſhal be firſt, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the people of God, who have hard pulls in time, to aſſay this Trade of truſting in God, and hoping in him;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47356:196"/>
it hath not an enemy but an ignorant, one that's a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to it, that knows not the worth that is in it, &amp; the rich advantages that follow it; were it more tryed, it would have more to commend it, therefore let it be more your ſtudy; and thou that would ſet about the Trade of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hoping in God, muſt not take the report concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith and hope, from every fit of a temptation, thou muſt lay thy account to meet with many a fiery dart, and with many a reproach caſt upon thy confidence, and to have thy ſelf counted a fool for cleaving to that way, but hold at it, and the more thou do ſo, thou ſhalt like it the better; not only wilt thou not need any to commend it unto thee, but thou wilt commend it to all that will take thy advice and counſel.</p>
            <p>And 2. They that have been eſſaying faith and hope, and have gotten good of it, they would be afraid in any after-aſſault they may be put to, to bring up an ill report upon the way of faith and hope; thou may let theſe that never got good of it, ſuſpect it; but thou that haſt been helped to believe and wait on God, and haſt ſeen an end of the Lord, and found the good of believing, that can with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.7. ſay, <hi>My heart truſted in him, and I am helped.</hi> How guilty muſt thou be, if thy faith and hope be to ſeek in a new ſtrait? If after thou haſt found the good of believing, thou be put out concerning it in a new trial, when that Song is caſt up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.1. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever:</hi> who-ever let that Note ly by the ſecond Verſe tells thee, <hi>Let the redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy.</hi> Who ever have a ſlender opinion of faith and hope, it ill becomes thee to have it, who has tryed it, and has found the good of it, or to be to ſeek in eſteeming of it in a new trial.</p>
            <p>But now I proceed to the 4th thing I propoſed to be ſpoken to from this Exhortation, that is, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47356:197"/>
of the perſons, who they are, to whom this hope in God is recommended, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord,</hi> ſaith he: Hope in God is not an Anchor that will be budded on every one. It's true, none are ſecluded from coming to ſeek a right to hope in the right method, and due order; but there is an hope of the hypocrite, that will periſh; that will be like the giving up of the Ghoſt, and that hope is only for fair weather, and for little to do, but this hope of the Saints is the peculiar allowance of the Saints at all times. Now for what is mean'd by <hi>Iſrael</hi> here, I ſhall not deny, but in the firſt place we are to underſtand, that Nation of Iſrael, a peculiar people to God, who in various Ages, while they continued a Church and Nation, were meeting with work for their hope, and with many rich advantages and proofs of the good of hoping in God; and in the latter days, when as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26 <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved;</hi> they ſhall find this made out to them, that they may hope in God. But it is not to be reſtricted to them only; ſince their off caſting, there is an <hi>Iſrael</hi> come in their place, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>That they are not all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, which are of Iſrael,</hi> all that Nation were not true <hi>Iſraelits</hi> in Gods account: So <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>There is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion even among the Gentiles, who do worſhip God in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and rejoice in Jeſus Chriſt, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. he tells, There is an <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, Gods peculiar people, of whatſoever Nation, upon whom, walking according to the Rule of the new Creature given them, there ſhall be peace and mercy. Again we may conſider <hi>Iſrael</hi> either Collectively, or Diſtributively; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Iſrael</hi> Collectively for the Church of God, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the ancient Nation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Then by <hi>Iſrael</hi> we are to underſtand the inviſible Church, the ſociety of Gods converted Elect through the World, yet not excluding particular viſible Churches, who partake of the priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, according to their purity, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47356:197"/>
the number of true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that are among them. Again, <hi>Iſrael</hi> taken Diſtributively, takes in every Child of God, who in his own place, according to the tenor of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath no leſs ground to hope in God, than <hi>Iſrael</hi> taken Collectively hath.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this Head, three things occurr to be ſpoken to,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a Society that is allowed to hope in God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this hope is the common allowance of all and every one that is indeed an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> as well as of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in general. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it concerns every one that would claim to hope in God in all exigencies, to make it ſure that they are true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, and may put their names in thoſe paſſages and promiſes, wherein <hi>Iſraels</hi> priviledges are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Iſrael</hi> are a people, that however mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go, have ground to hope in God, however things fare in the world, or whatever may be ſaid of the deſperat caſe of others, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a Society that may ſtill hope in God. Hence when <hi>Ezra, Chap.</hi> 9 is laid by with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for that generation that had mingled with the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Heathen, a godly man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.2. comes and tells him, It's true, we are guilty, <hi>yet there is hope in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el concerning this thing:</hi> Had ſuch a thing fallen forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, it had been a preſage of dreadful news; but in <hi>Iſrael</hi> there is hope of pardon, hope of redreſs, hope of making up this breach, in <hi>Iſrael</hi> things otherwiſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are not hopeleſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.15, 17. Though in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> there be a <hi>Rachel weeping for her children, and refuſing to be comforted, becauſe they are not.</hi> She looks upon it as needleſs to offer to comfort her, when her Children are gone; yet even when they are not, and ſhe thinks, that rationally ſhe refuſed to be comforted. Verſe 17. <hi>There
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47356:198"/>
is hope in thy end, ſaith the Lord, that thy children ſhall come again to their own border.</hi> It's <hi>Iſraels</hi> priviledge, that ſhe can ſay that none elſe can ſay: It's <hi>Iſraels</hi> Song <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, may Iſrael now ſay:</hi> She might ſay it, when others might forbear it, <hi>yet have they not prevailed againſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nebuchadnezar</hi> got me ſwallowed down quick, but I proved ſpending mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and he was forced to caſt up that ſweet morſel, <hi>The plowers plowed upon my back, and they made long their furrows, but the righteous Lord hath cut aſunder the cords of the wicked.</hi> It's <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s priviledge, as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.22, 23. To have <hi>the cup of trembling taken out of her hand, and put into the hand of them that afflicted her</hi> &amp;c. It's long ſince, if it had been preſtable or practicable, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have been ſweept off the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.4. There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, <hi>Come, let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of Iſrael may be no more in remembrance;</hi> and yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to the ſore, hoping in God. It is true, it's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be peremptor in applying this to particular viſible Churches, for God has taken away his Candleſtick from many viſible Churches, for their provocations, yet there are two things that we may ſafely go upon in the application of this; one is, That where God in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is much concerned, as having ſignally interpoſed for a people, to make them his own; there is ground of hope that God will not caſt off that people for their provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For this conſider <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.12. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. When God is threatning to cut off his people for their provocations, <hi>Moſes</hi> interpoſes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with God, <hi>O let not that be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Why ſhould the Egyptians ſay, for miſchief he brought them out, to ſtay them, in the mountains, and to conſume them from the face of the earth, becauſe thou was not able to bring them into the land which thou promiſed them;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Lord, thou haſt been eminently ſeen in owning this people, and if thou
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:47356:198"/>
ſhalt ruine them, it will eminently reflect upon thy Glory, as well as it will deſtroy them. And <hi>Joſhua Chap.</hi> 7. when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſmitten upon the account of the accurſed thing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd he hath ſtrong apprehenſions, that the Nations about will environ them, and cut them off; his great argument (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) is, <hi>What wilt thou do unto thy own great Name:</hi> Thou haſt been eminent in owning thy people, and if they ſhall be ruined, thy great Name will ſuffer. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. Thoſe complaints of the deſolation of the Sanctuary, and the inſolency of the Enemy, are cloſed with that, <hi>How long ſhall the enemy reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy Name for ever?</hi> This is one thing then that we may hold, that where God hath been eminently ſeen in working for a people, he will ſee to his great Name, that there be no ill report brought up upon his guiding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>em, as if for miſchief he brought them out, to ſlay them upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. And another thing we may cloſe with, which is more general, that whatever God do with a particular viſible Church, he will never want a Church, though he ſhould take his leave of one Nation for their provocations, he will go to another. So long as he is a Head, he will not want Members; ſo long as he is a Huſband, he will not want a Spouſe; ſo long as he is a King, he will not want Subjects. There muſt be an <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who will have ground to hope in God.</p>
            <p>There are many things which might be inferred from this, I might from it exhort all wiſely to conſider of the caſe of God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that they would beware of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that there is no hope for them in God. Beware of looking upon them, with a look of rejoycing over them, and ſpeaking proudly in the day of their diſtreſs, <hi>Obadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ah verſ.</hi> 12, 13 <hi>There is hope in Iſrael, though Iſrael were as dry bones, and as dead men, their dry bones ſhall live,</hi> they ſhall up again; and therefore take heed both what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou paſſes on them, and what thy carriage is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

them; they may be laid low, as for their own ſins and provocations, ſo for a trial to thee, to bring out what was lurking in thy boſome before, and thou durſt not bring it out while thou got ſuch an opportunity; and when he hath done both, he will make it appear, that there is hope in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to leave this, I would preſs upon the people of God, to improve this their priviledge and allowance of hope in God; tine not heart, caſt not away your confidence, which hath a great recompence of reward. I preſs not carnal confidence, or carnal hopes upon any, I pray the Lord, the troubles many are under, may cruſh theſe; but yet I would bid you cheriſh the hope of God's being great in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> cheriſh divine hope, that is bottomed on the Word; ye who have it, your hopes are better than other folks poſſeſſions, your Bible is better than any ſecurity ye could ſeek without it: And in deducing this Uſe, I would in the firſt place recommend to you that are Iſraelites, that ye would mind your work, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21. <hi>This people have</hi> I <hi>formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> Iſrael are ſet apart for celebrating Gods praiſe, and to celebrate his praiſe in that particular, by hoping in him, when their ſouls are caſt down and diſquieted in them. Thou art not at thy work in thy generation, who are not ſhewing forth Gods praiſe, by thy believing and hoping in him. 2. Ye would remember how peremptory, reſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be, and ſhould be, in hoping in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt believe, when ſhe cannot ſee, and when ſhe cannot give a diſtinct account of what ſhe believes, ſhe muſt believe, when ſhe cannot give the grounds of it. I ſhall give you an account of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Faith and Hope, in the words of <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Eſther, Chap.</hi> 4.14. If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, then ſhall there deliverance and enlargement ariſe to the <hi>Jews</hi> from another place; But <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would have
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47356:199"/>
puzled his wit, and the wit of all the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> to tell from what airt deliverance and enlargement ſhould come to the <hi>Jews;</hi> If <hi>Eſther</hi> ſhould hold her peace, how was it poſſible they ſhould be delivered; if God ſhould not make uſe of her, the Heathen in an hundred and twenty ſeven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces would ſoon cut them off, when a decree was paſt to do it. But though <hi>Eſther</hi> ſhould hold her peace, <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> believes enlargement will come to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> periſh they cannot; therefore delivered they muſt be, though he could not tell from whence it ſhould come. The not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of this is a dreadful temptation to many; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is low, not only to caſt away their confidence, but to betake themſelves to ſome ſinful ſhift for their ſecurity; but it were better for thee ſo long as thou haſt the Bible, for the ground of thy hope, to hold the concluſion, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhal not periſh. 3. <hi>I</hi> recommend to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they may be called, to ſtoop ere they quit their hope of delivery, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. Give wicked <hi>Jeboram</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be delivered, and relieved of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, he will go in ſackcloth, in hopes of performance; but let it come to that, that one harlot contends with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the eating of her ſon, have at <hi>Eliſha's</hi> head, he will not wait for the Lord any longer; but <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his hope muſt ſtoop low, his anchor of hope muſt have a long cable, (If I may ſo word it) to reach the bottomleſs Sea of hopeleſneſs, <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt not loſe hope, when it comes to that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.

            <p>WE are here upon a very uſeful Counſel, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel dictated by the Holy Spirit of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat by a man that had tryed the good and ill, both of having and wanting it; ye have heard how the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> being delivered, is communicative of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to others; ye have heard alſo, as ye will have conſtant need of Hope, ſo there is a conſtant warrand for it: And ye have heard further, that whatever be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of others, yet whoſoever have moſt tryed Faith and Hope, they will commend them moſt, and be moſt free in recommending them, to thoſe that have moſt uſe for them. I entered in the morning to conſider the perſons, to whom hope in God is recommended, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord.</hi> Whether that Nation while it ſtood a Church, or the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; The Goſpel Church, or the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

            <p>I proceed now to the 2d thing I mentioned in this Head, to wit, That Hope in God is the common allowance of all the people of God, not only taking <hi>Iſrael</hi> collectively, but diſtributively, one by one, they are allowed to hope in God; yea, (which will further clear the ground of the Doctrine) although many that were true <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> did indeed come ſhort of the Pſalmiſt; and therefore though he might hope, it might be thought they ſhould ſtand a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are alſo Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made to ſome ſaints on particular accounts, to which every one may not claim; but if we conſider the great bull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the Promiſes, which are the ground of hope, and the main ſcope of all the Promiſes; the Scripture takes in one and other, as to ſexes; the Promiſe is deduced. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>I will be a father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters,</hi> &amp;c. where the weaker and ſtronger, and ſexes are equally taken in, alſo as to the Degrees of grace, if it be true, it takes in all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.13. <hi>He will bleſs them that fear the Lord, both ſmall and great,</hi> the ſmall as well as the great are taken in to the ſhare of Bleſſings; The precious Oyntment poured upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head, ſtays not about his ſhoulders, or the principal parts of his Body, but goes down to the ſkirts of his Garments, to the meaneſt and loweſt Members; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.2.

to look out to thoſe riches in the Promiſes; but ye would know, that hope in God is the allowance of all the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> of God, that on the nail faſtned in a ſure place, and who is given as a glorious Throne to his Father's Houſe, not only will be hung the Veſſels of Flagons, but the off-ſpring and the iſſue, and all Veſſels of ſmall quantity, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.24.

            <p>And this leads me to the 3d thing that I propoſed, to be ſpoken to upon this Head, That is, That however hope in God be the common allowance of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> great and ſmall, yet it is the allowance only of them, who are <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> indeed; and therefore all that I have ſpoken hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, concerning an allowance, to hope in God will be of little purpoſe to thee and me, except that we can make it out, that we are of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to hope in him; it is dangerous for dogs to take the childrens bread: No but when folk endeavour to be children, they may have hope; but when they cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hoping they are children, and take a blind gueſs to lean to, in ſtead of hope, it is dangerous. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what I marked in the morning, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 6. That they are not all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there is a <hi>Jew</hi> outwardly, and a <hi>Jew</hi> inwardly, and there is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and baptiſm, which is outward in the fleſh, and there is a circumciſion and baptiſm which is inward of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the letter, a circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

And therefore hope being the great cordial that is allowed to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, I would have all excited in order to the making of it ſure, to make ſure work in this buſineſs, to prove and try whether they be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, upon whom this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial is allowed, and here, if I ſhould follow out this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at large, it would lead me to give all the marks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, the marks of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed; or if <hi>I</hi> ſhould inſiſt on theſe Characters of the true Circumciſion, that worſhip God in the Spirit &amp; rejoyce in Jeſus Chriſt, that have no confidence in the fleſh, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.3. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get true Religion in ſhorter bounds nor in theſe words, whether ye read them backward or foreward, or both backward and foreward, as bairns do the A, B, C. A true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> muſt have no confidence in the fleſh, all muſt be fleſh to him that's not Chriſt, and he muſt deny all confidence in it, whether they be fleſhly priviledges, or any thing but Chriſt; and his renouncing confidence in the fleſh, ſhould lead him to believe in Chriſt alone for Salvation, and rejoyce in him; and the truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in Chriſt, ſhould appear in worſhipping God in Chriſt, with inward and ſpiritual affections. And go backward, his worſhipping of God in Spirit, leads him back to rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus for his ſalvation; and his rejoycing in Chriſt leads him back to renounce all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh, and to look upon believing in Chriſt, as no hopeleſs bargain: But I ſay, if I ſhould inſiſt upon theſe, I ſhould digreſs too much on this Head: Therefore in deciphering who are true <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> that have ground of hope in God, I ſhall confine my ſelf to theſe two;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The time and occaſion of <hi>Jacob's</hi> getting the Name of <hi>Iſrael, when he wreſtles with God in prayer.</hi>

            <p>For the firſt, if ye will read the 32 of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the firſt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47356:202"/>
time <hi>Jacob</hi> got this name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was when he is at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with God; and compare it with <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. Ye will find ſome notable Characters of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> or regenerat man, when he ſhould be at the exerciſe of Hope, in particular difficulties and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>
            <p>And firſt in general, <hi>Jacob</hi> got that Name when he was at his Prayers, that was the poſture wherein he was, when inſtead of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he got the Name of <hi>Iſrael, a prince and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer with God;</hi> the Lord tells it him, <hi>verſe</hi> 28. He was a man, who when he had any thing to do in the world, he ſeyed God firſt with it, he laboured to diſcuſs all his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties at the Throne of Grace. A Prayerleſs frame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not alwayes an evidence of a graceleſs man, yet it is an evidence of a graceleſs frame, wherein the ground of Hope is much under the water, in a cloud, and in the dark; a Praying Supplicant is an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, in neareſt capacity to put forth Hope on God; thou that can go through thy difficulties, and not begin at God to diſcuſs them, to ſeek an account of thy preſſures and griefs, remember <hi>Sauls</hi> pretence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.12. For his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, he would force himſelf, and offer a burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring without <hi>Samuel,</hi> before he made not ſupplication and intreated the Face of God for favour and peace; now this of Prayer being the general, the other particulars that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low will deduce it more diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he is called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he is at occaſional Prayer; <hi>Jacob</hi> as he was a godly man, he had his ordinar addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God; <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father had his times of going out to the fields to pray, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.62. and <hi>David</hi> at evening, at morning, and at noon will cry aloud, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>7. But <hi>Jacob's</hi> ordinar diligence in prayer, will not ſerve him, when a particular emergent of Providence preſſes him, but he then doubles his diligence, we find him twice at it, once <hi>verſe</hi> 9. when he hears that <hi>Eſau</hi> was coming againſt him, he runs firſt to God by prayer; and another application
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47356:203"/>
we find <hi>verſe</hi> 24. — when he had ſent over his Goods, and his Wives and Servants over the foord, he falls a wreſtling with the Angel of the Covenant, until the break of day; what ſhall I ſay to many <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in profeſſion, who have not an habite of ordinary converſing with God in prayer? But what ſhall I ſay further to them, who though they have ordinary addreſſes to God; yet when they have peculiar occaſions of prayer put in their hands, do not double their diligence in that duty. O! but diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties growing, and diligence in Prayer not out-grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; when eminent difficulties put not folk to double their diligence in prayer, what wonder they get a ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, and that their neglect of prayer obſcure the evidences of their being <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>But 3. Conſider that this prayer of <hi>Jacob's,</hi> when he gets the Name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it was an occaſional Prayer, ſo it was a ſecret prayer, it is when <hi>verſe</hi> 23. he has ſent all that he had over the brook, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. he is left alone, and there are none with him, that he wreſtles with the Angel till the dawning of the day, that is like an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, and like an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that hath very clear ground of hope, when whatever be betwixt God and them in publick, or in the view of others, they have ay ſomewhat to liſp to God in ſecret, ſome counſel is betwixt God and them, they have ſomewhat to ſay to him, and ſeek of him, to which they would not willingly have others witneſs, that is an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> indeed, whoſe inſide is beſt, whoſe ſecret diligence is that wherein he meets with moſt of God, who loves to retire himſelf out of the croud of publick worſhippers, to mutter ſomewhat in his Fathers boſom; look to it, what conſcience ye make of ſecret prayer; ſome have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of prayer, but that which is ſecret, other ſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſecret, have the burden of publick prayer, and ye know how it lies in the mire, totally neglected in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and when ye put God out of the family, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ye get worſe company? But ye who are about Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Prayer, conſider how it goes with you in ſecret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, think with your ſelves, here it is that I am put to the Teſt, here I muſt give an account, if I be an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, when I want the wind of applauſe, when I have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver but God, and am without fear of cenſure, now I am to look to what is under my tongue; diligence in ſecret prayer, is the character of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, who hath ground to hope in God.</p>
            <p>But 4. If ye conſider theſe prayers of <hi>Jacob's,</hi> ye will find, that it is a very humble prayer, O! but he is very humble when he begins, and when he comes away from prayer. The Preface <hi>verſe</hi> 10. is, <hi>Lord, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies;</hi> The Original (as it is in the Margin) emphatically reads it, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mercies, and all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed to thy Servant;</hi> O! but there was an humble man, the leaſt of all the mercies that had been droped on him, ſo bulks with him, that he is leſs than the leaſt of them. Was not that a fit man (if I may ſpeak of the fitneſs of ſinful duſt) to ſpeak to God? yea, as he began humble, ſo he comes off humble; though he wreſtled fervently, and would not let the Angel of the Covenant go, till he bleſt them, yet he came off halting, he gets an humbling halt in his wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling, that made him lame all his days, and why? even to teach us that the moſt eminent, and near acceſs, that true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gets to God, puts them, and keeps them in the duſt; look to it, puffed up perſons, that do not, that cannot be at a low ſail. I ſhall not determine on your Grace, but ſure it is not like an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it is not like them, that have eminent ground of hope; the humble Supplicant is the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall add 5th. when <hi>Jacob</hi> got the Name of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> he is not only praying, but he is very fervent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he is wreſtling in prayer; it is ſo called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24.

            <p>THE Pſalmiſt, as ye have heard, when he ſees through his own wreſtling, he cannot, will not be but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-minded to the Lord's <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and if he hath gotten any good in wreſtling with God under difficulties, guilt and delays of comfort or iſſue, the very good he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, enlargeth his heart, and makes him publick-minded
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47356:205"/>
towards others; and what ever be the hight of his own enlargement, he doth not forget, that Faith and Hope will be ſtill neceſſary; neither doth he forget, that there is a conſtant warrand for Faith and Hope in God, and that they are of ſo univerſal and conſtant uſe; and what-ever others may think of that exerciſe, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be he himſelf thought of it, when he was in the midſt of the trial, yet he now in his practice makes it out, that theſe who try Faith and Hope moſt, will eſteem them moſt, and will be moſt confident in recommending them to all others of the Lords people.</p>
            <p>That which now I am upon, is the conſideration of the perſons to whom hope in God is recommended, it is to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whether we take them Collectively or Diſtributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one by one; ye have heard that hope in God is the common allowance of all the people of God: Not only is <hi>Iſrael</hi> a ſociety, that may ſtill hope, however matters go, or what-ever their caſe be, but hope in God, according to the nature and tenor of the promiſes, is the common al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of all and every one of them; and in purſuance of this, I broke in upon that great point, and our duty, that ſeing however hope be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon allowance of all &amp; every one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet it is their allowance only who are Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites indeed. Therefore theſe that would claim to that allowance of hope in God, they would make it ſure that they are Iſraelites indeed, that though they be not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael, yet that they are Iſraelites in the ſpirit, though not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. And forbearing to ſpeak abſtractly of the marks of regeneration, I offered two things to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, for clearing up who they are who are Iſraelites indeed, and may claim to this allowance. One is, the occaſion of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s getting this name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he was with God in Prayer; to which I have ſpoken, and led you through ſome Characters of Iſraelites indeed, who have
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47356:205"/>
ground of hope in God, which I gathered from his Prayers.</p>
            <p>Now I am to touch a little upon that other thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſpoken unto, to find out theſe Iſraelites, to whom hope in God belongs, and that is the Character gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them by way of Explication, who they are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael,</hi> and who are there? Even <hi>ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> I ſhall not offer to make any common place of this, but in reference to my ſcope in following forth this point, as ye heard the laſt day, that the Iſraelite indeed is a praying man; ſo ye would take a look here of an Iſraelite indeed: Firſt, as a ſelf-purifying man, one that purifies his heart. An Iſraelite indeed, his great work is about his heart, he is one that deſires to look as God doth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Man looketh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but God looketh on the heart;</hi> and ſo doth the <hi>Iſraelite indeed,</hi> he deſires to have that Character, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.— Not to be <hi>a Jew outwardly,</hi> or to have <hi>that circumciſion</hi> or baptiſm <hi>which is outward in the fleſh; but to be a Jew</hi> or Chriſtian <hi>inwardly,</hi> and to have that <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> and baptiſm <hi>of the heart,</hi> to be one <hi>in the spirit, and not in the letter,</hi> to be one, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> An <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, is one whoſe great ſtudy is, <hi>to keep the heart with all diligence,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> enjoyns, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.33. <hi>for out of it are the iſsues of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in looking after his heart, is a man that finds very much pollution there, and that needs to be cleanſed and purged. He is a man that the further he goes in ſearching after himſelf, he finds ſtill the greater and the greater abominations. He is a man, that though he bleſs God (as he hath reaſon) that he is kept from outward out-breakings; yet when he looks within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he never wants that which makes him humble, and to carry a low Sail, ſo long as he finds his heart a Cage of unclean Birds. He is a man in whoſe ears doth ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47356:206"/>
that word which ye have <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayest be ſaved, how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> He is one that abom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nats, and is ſenſible of the manifold pollutions of his heart, not only upon the account of the many and groſs evils that he finds there, of the ſuſpitions of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and formality in the performance of duties, that he is afraid he pleaſe himſelf with; or on this account, that his heart ſhould be Gods Throne, and kept at the Brides Chamber for the Beloved, and he finds it no ſuch thing; but further upon this account and conſideration, that he finds his heart can act more wickedneſs in a ſhort time, than many bodies could commit for a long time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſenſe that the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed hath of his heart-pollutions, appears in his endeavours to be cleanſed from them, that he may have his heart waſhed from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He is a man that will not pay God with a ſighing and going backward; he is not ſatisfied, that his pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he knows them, and his uncleanneſſes are with him: No, no, he muſt be further benn, nothing but boſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhing, heart-cleanſing will ſatisfy, and he muſt be ſet ſeriouſly on work to that; and whereas other folk take their Faith, their Hope and Confidence to play them with, all the ſtock that he hath of Faith, Hope and Confidence, or that he can win to, he puts it out to help to purge his heart, according to that word, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> It not only imports that the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed finds, that there is no way of purging he heart, but by Faith in Chriſt. But further, if he get any Faith, he ſets it on work to purifie his heart. And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> If he get any hope of being made like Chriſt, his ſenſe of the pollution of his heart is ſuch, that it ſets him on work to purify the heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This endeavour of a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> will not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47356:206"/>
in vain, and without ſucceſs, but he may win, through grace, to be of a clean heart, as the Pſalmiſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones, although he win not to perfection, yet he may win to that commended in <hi>Nathanael,</hi> Joh. 1.7. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile:</hi> Do not underſtand it, that there is any <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that hath not the ſeeds of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and guile, But he is an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, that hath not approved of predomining, or reigning guile and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and that may be win at, which I ſpeak for their encouragment who are true <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 5. This ſenſe of inward pollution, and endeavour to purify the heart, through the exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt, it will appear in the outward converſation; if a man be an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, in whom there is no approven guile, that muſt accompany him which ye have, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. He muſt be a man that walks according to the Rule of the new Creature.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are ſome brief hints, which I have given you of the Characters of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed; but when I have minted thus to decipher him, I have not done with this point, it's a concerning point indeed, to make it ſure that ye are true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who may lay claim to hope in God: And therefore I would preſs it a little further, in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, if I ſhould offer to you motives from what I ſaid before, of <hi>Iſraels</hi> having ſtill ground of hope in God, I ſhould run in a round, and come back upon that which ye have heard; and therefore to preſs it another way, I ſhall preſs you to conſider what is ſaid of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, which may help to ſtir you up to make it ſure that ye are of that number, that have ground of hope in God. I find in that fore-cited place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. Mercy and peace to be to their allowance, <hi>peace be on them, and mercy, and upon all the Iſrael of God;</hi> mercy for their miſeries, and peace for their diſquiets and vexations. And I find it ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. That <hi>truly God is good to Iſraels</hi> It is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:47356:207"/>
beyond all peradventure, that he is good to them, which goodneſs is a ſolid ground of hope in all exigencies, that it ſhall be well with <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And to preſs this motive, if the Lord may pleaſe to bleſs it for your quickening and up-ſtirring, to make it ſure ye are of that number, and ſo have good ground to hope in God, I ſhall deduce this goodneſs of God to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in three or four ſteps only.</p>
            <p>And 1. In the general conſider, that the goodneſs of God to his people, is unqueſtionably ſo great, and ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, that were it well known, it could not but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally invite all to ſhare in it, by becoming true <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> I may ſay of Gods goodneſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid to that woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> If folk knew this goodneſs, they would need no other motive to excite them to be <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they might ſhare in it. That is remarkable which we find of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. <hi>They ſhall come and ſing in the hight of Zion, and ſhall flow together to the goodneſs of the Lord, for wheat, and wine, and for oyl, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their ſoul ſhall be as a watered garden, and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all.</hi> What a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſatisfying thing muſt the goodneſs of God be, that hath ſuch effects: And <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>I will ſatiate the ſoul of the prieſts with fatneſs, and my people ſhall be ſatisfied with my goodneſs, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It's beyond all peradventure, that the goodneſs of God to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſo ſatisfying and ſatiating, that it hath not a ſlighter, but he that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it; were it known, mens reaſon would tell them that they were irrational, if they ſhould not ſeek to ſhare in it.</p>
            <p>But 2. For your exciting to enquire after it in general, ye would conſider, that it is a goodneſs whereof little account can be given, but by experience; there is no
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:47356:207"/>
deſcribing of it, but by feeling of it. <hi>David</hi> when he is overcome with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. ſays, <hi>O taste and ſee that the Lord is good, bleſſed is the man that truſts in him.</hi> A man muſt experimentally taſte of, before he can ſee this goodneſs of God as it is: And we find, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. the Apoſtle lays a great ſtreſs on this, that no man <hi>as a new born babe can deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that he may grow thereby,</hi> but he that hath <hi>taſted that the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi> If one ſhould enquire, what is all this goodneſs of God that ſhould invite me to make it ſure, that I am an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> that I may ſhare in it? There is no anſwer comparable to this, <hi>Taſte and ſee that the Lord is good:</hi> Speak of it to a ſtranger to it, in experience he cannot take it up; <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The heart knoweth its own bitterneſs, and a ſtranger doth not intermedle with his joy.</hi> The world knows not what is betwixt God and his people, either in their ups or downs: And if it be thought, that theſe who have taſted of this goodneſs, can give an account of it, ye will find them profeſs, that the hight of the account they can give of it, is to ſit down and wonder at it, to admire it, as being ſurcharged and overcome with it. What ſaith <hi>David</hi> of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7, 8. <hi>How excellent is thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O Lord! therefore the children of men put their truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of thy wings. They ſhall be abundantly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſure.</hi> And Pſal. 31.19. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſs, which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee!</hi> &amp;c. He wonders at it, as being overcome with it, but he cannot well make language of that which he feels of Gods goodneſs to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo that experience is the only ſit mean, to bring folk to know and take up how good God is.</p>
            <p>But yet 3. The Scripture is not wanting to give ſuch hints of it, as we are capable of, and ſuch as may tell us, that it is a matchleſs goodneſs; I ſhall not offer
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:47356:208"/>
to enter upon this deep, to ſpeak of all the goodneſs and kindneſs of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from Election to Converſion, from Converſion to Glorification. To eſſay to find out or fathom this Ocean, were to loſe our ſelves in this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. There are three general words, which if we would ponder, might give ſome hints of this matchleſs goodneſs of God to his people: As 1. That in an appropriated and peculiar ſenſe, it is ſaid, That <hi>God is good to Iſrael:</hi> Is he good to none elſe? Yes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9 <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works,</hi> Pſal 104.24. <hi>The earth is full of his riches.</hi> Pſal. 33 5. <hi>The earth is full of his goodneſs;</hi> yet notwithſtanding all that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all his creatures, it is ſaid in an appropriat and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſenſe, <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael.</hi> It's a goodneſs indeed, a goodneſs by it ſelf; whence <hi>I</hi> infer, that if the common goodneſs of God to all (which being compared with his peculiar goodneſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doth ſcarce deſerve that name) be ſo rich and full, how rich and full muſt that his appropriat and peculiar goodneſs to his choſen people be? If the crumbs caſt to the dogs, and caſt to them in wrath, be ſo plentiful, what muſt the covered Table of his goodneſs to his children be? If the common out-Paſture be ſo rank and fat, what muſt the Incloſure be? If his common communications be ſuch a goodneſs, what a goodneſs is that, and what are theſe ſpecial communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are reſerved for the Chambers? O! When thou ſees the men of this world glutting themſelves with Gods common goodneſs, and bleſſing themſelves in it, as being ſo rich and ſatisfying to them, wilt thou then conſider how much more rich and ſatisfying muſt his peculiar and Chamber-goodneſs be? that kindneſs muſt be a far other thing.</p>
            <p>A 2d thing that may offer ſome account of this goodneſs, <hi>I</hi> take from the various names it gets in Scriptu;e; that one Attribute of the goodneſs of God, which ye have in
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:47356:208"/>
your Catechiſm, comprehends ſeveral under it, or it may undergo ſeveral notions of this goodneſs of God, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſeveral caſes of the children of men; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it's called goodneſs, it's all good; and therefore all that thou an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> meets with in thy way homeward, thou may write upon it, <hi>This ſhall work together for my good, Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>We know,</hi> &amp;c. Thou mayeſt ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Surely goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my life.</hi> Thou may ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68. <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good,</hi> and therefore he will do good to thee. Thou may ſay, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted.</hi> That is one bleſt hint of the goodneſs of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that what ever an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> meets with, it is goodneſs, or it hath goodneſs written upon it. Again, this goodneſs is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his love, <hi>Jer,</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting love, therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> It is called love, to make ſure the former, that he will do nothing to his people, but that which is good for them, becauſe his love cannot endure to hurt them. Who can expect any thing from love, but that which is good. And love, becauſe he will reſt in his love, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. Love, that when any thing would interpoſe to interrupt it to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will not hear tell of it, he will reſt in his love: he hath loved them, and will love them ſtill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, becauſe an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> hath no price to purchaſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he needs it, therefore goodneſs is called grace, upon the account of his freedom, that all the goodneſs he communicats to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it ſhall be <hi>without money, and without price:</hi> That if an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> has no price, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently has nothing to give for it, he hath to do with one, that can take no price, but communicats his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs freely. And further, if thou be one that art not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthleſs, and haſt no price, but thou art ſuch an one, as art lying low in miſery, haſt none to have pity on thee, or bemoan thee, or to turn aſide to aſk how thou doſt?
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:47356:209"/>
His goodneſs is mercy, with a relation to thy miſery, to conſider thy trouble, to know thy ſoul in adverſities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.7. To remember thee in thy low eſtate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23. To ſit down beſide thee, and to ſtoop to the very duſt unto thee, that's his goodneſs. And I ſhall add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for finding out of this goodneſs, that if thou who art an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> be vexed with thy own waywardneſs, untractablneſs, what will then the goodneſs of God do unto thee in that caſe? The goodneſs of God to thee in that caſe, is patience &amp; long-ſuffering, to wait long upon a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> to ſuffer his manners in the Wilderneſs, not to chide with thee continually, nor to retain anger for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but to ſee thy ways, and heal thee, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.17. <hi>in</hi> Further, if thou be one that is not only wayward, but hath provocked him to ſtrike thee with the rod, what will good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do to thee then? I ſhall not reſume what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71. It is good for thee that thou art afflicted; but in that caſe, the goodneſs of God ſhall be clemency and moderation to thee, to puniſh thee leſs than thy iniquities deſerve, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. When thy luxuriant branches of corruption ſhoot forth, to debate with thee in meaſure, to <hi>ſtay his rough wind in the day of his eaſt-wind,</hi> Iſai. 27.8. He ſhall exerciſe ſuch clemency and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards thee, that ſhall be admired and wondred at by thee, when thou gets a right look of it. Thus, as the common goodneſs of God to all, is one ſtep to lift thee up to the conſideration of his appropriat and peculiar good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his people, ſo the many notes put upon his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar goodneſs, or the many ſhapes (if I may ſo term it) wherein it turns it ſelf unto thee, of goodneſs, love, grace, mercy, patience, long-ſuffering, clemency, and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how do theſe ſet forth how good God is to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to thee who art one of them. There is yet a 3d hint of this goodneſs, which may be taken up more particularly, in reference to <hi>Iſraels</hi> various caſes. And there's a 4th general
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:47356:209"/>
word to be ſaid of it, that it is no complement, but a real goodneſs; both which I leave till the Afternoon. God bleſs what ye have heard, for Chriſts ſake.</p>

               </gap> this goodneſs of God, held out in the Word, how it keeps all temptations that they hurt not the true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but makes them work for their good; how it is love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, how it is grace and free grace to the unworthy, mercy to them in miſery, patience and long-ſuffering to the way-ward, clemency and moderation to them that wring ſtroaks out of his hand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now add a word or two further, that will help to give an account what this goodneſs of God is to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that is in the 3d place, to take a look of it in reference to the various caſes of the Saints; though the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we had of it in the morning do look here-away, yet I ſhall now deduce this conſideration of it more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
            <p>And 1. That <hi>God is good to Iſrael,</hi> it may encourage <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> under weakneſs; for why?

            <p n="2">2. That God is good to Iſrael, it may encourage them (as I was hinting in the morning) againſt unworthineſs in themſelves, <hi>For</hi> (as ye will hear in the progreſs) <hi>with the Lord there is mercy,</hi> for Iſrael, ſaith the Text; Seek all Chriſts Court, there is not a worthy perſon of all he hath, but himſelf; and if there be any addition, any competition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſt's train and followers, it lies in this, who ſhall be the greateſt dyvors and debters to free Grace, who ſhall be the moſt unworthy, <hi>leſs than the leaſt of his mercies;</hi> who ſhall be the <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> theſe whom <hi>David</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to ſit at his Table; but worthleſneſs is a noble claim in Iſrael, a dyvor bill is a noble paſport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Lord will) I will have occaſion in the progreſs to ſpeak more amply.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The goodneſs of God to <hi>Iſrael</hi> may encourage them againſt the contempt they meet with, and the mean and low condition, wherein they are put in the world, many a time our hearts think it a wonder, that the Blood-Royal of Heaven, the excellent Ones in the Earth ſhould be no more eſteemed of in the World, while we little mind that word, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Therefore the world knoweth us not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it knew him not.</hi> Otherwayes we would think it a wonder that the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, are not made the filth and off-ſcourings of all things; yea, but the goodneſs of God is a cordial to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this caſe, let the world count them the filth and off-ſcourings of all things, yet <hi>the Lord hath choſen Jacob for himſelf, and Iſrael for his peculiar treaſure, Pſal.</hi> 135.4. Let their neareſt relations caſt them off, he will not caſt off any of his <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> could ſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10. <hi>when my father and my mother forſake me, then the Lord will take me up;</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.21. <hi>O Iſrael, thou ſhalt not be forgotten of me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> that is <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s priviledge; and <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>The Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himſelf in Iſrael.</hi> The world may leave the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God, to ſend for themſelves, but in that caſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> may ſing, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.4. <hi>He that keepeth Iſrael ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep, the Lord is his keeper, the Lord is a ſhade upon his right hand, the Sun ſhall not ſmite them by day, nor the Moon by night; the Lord ſhall preſerve them from evil, he ſhall preſerve their ſoul, he ſhall preſerve their going out, and their coming in, from this time forth and even for evermore;</hi> So that in all caſes <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath ground of encouragement in the goodneſs of God, and who would look upon theſe things and believe them, and not think themſelves enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make it ſure, that they are of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that ſhare in theſe mercies, and priviledges.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the 4th word, that I propoſed to be ſpoken to, for preſſing you to ſtudy to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47356:211"/>
Spirit, and that is, that this goodneſs of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that I have been minting to lay before you (though I have been but ſpilling it in the ſpeaking to it) it is not cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deviſed fables, it is not to trapane you in a courſe, wherein your expectations will be defeat; but all that is ſaid of it, are the true and faithful ſayings of God. I ſhall only offer to illuſtrat this in three words, and I have done with the Point. 1. What is the language of all the common goodneſs of God to your ſelves, to you who are profane, to you who are rebels, to you who are mockers at all Religion, that think it an evidence of a ſilly Spirit, to fall in love with holineſs; What means all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon goodneſs of God to you? (I ſay) that he makes not the Earth open and ſwallow you up quick into the pit, as he did <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that he puts not forth his hand to ſweep you off the Earth, or makes you not monuments of his Juſtice and Judgment upon it? Know ye (I ſay again) What all this means? I ſhall give it you in that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. The riches of his goodneſs and forbearance, leads, or ſhould lead you to repentance, that ſo ye may come in to know, what his ſpecial and ſingular goodneſs to <hi>Iſrael</hi> means, he is laying invitations at thy door, who art traverſing thy wayes, whom the wind has bound up in its wings, and who art as light as the wind in following thy follies, inviting thee to come in and be an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, that thou may ſhare in his peculiar goodneſs, and put him to it, as he bids you. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. See <hi>if he will prove a wilderneſs, or a land of drought to you;</hi> He gives you a bill of defyance, if ye will turn in to him, and be his <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed, that ye ſhall turn your back upon him, and ſay, he diſappointed you. 2. The Scripture intimats the reality of his goodneſs to all his Creatures, his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is palpable to all creatures beſide man, <hi>Job</hi> 36.41. <hi>He provideth for the ravens their food, when their young ones cry unto him, the young lyons roar after their prey, and ſeek their meat from God, Pſal.</hi> 104.21. <hi>He feeds the fouls of the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47356:212"/>
air, he cloaths the lillies and the graſſe in the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven, Mat.</hi> 6.20. And from all this, our bleſſed Lord gathers, <hi>verſe</hi> 30. <hi>If God provide for fowls, and ſo clothe the graſs, will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</hi> If God be good to all his creatures, and will he not be good to his own children? And a 3. word to illuſtrat it, Chriſt gives you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.9. from Parents goodneſs to their Children, who if they ask bread, will not give them a ſtone, or if they ask a fiſh, will not give them a ſerpent; and then infers, <hi>if ye then being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your father which is in heaven give good gifts to them that ask him;</hi> So God's common goodneſs to your ſelves, his common goodneſs to all the creatures, and the natural affection of parents to their children, all of theſe concur to demonſtrat, that the goodneſs of God towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is real and no complement; and therefore to ſhut up this purpoſe with this word of Exhortation, that ye would ſeek to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, and to leave it at every ones door, that do not ſtudy to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, that they forſake their own mercy; in ſlighting this peculiar good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and ſuch as do ſo, let them ſtand to their own hazard; ſo I have done with the Exhortation, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to conſider the encouragements, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or grounds on which the Pſalmiſt preſſes, that <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> ſhould hope in God; <hi>For with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption, and he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his troubles and iniquities;</hi> ye ſee the Arguments are taken partly from what is with God, or in God, and his power, for the good of his people, mercy and Redemption, and that in great plenty, that is, authority and power to give a proof of his mercy to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to rid them from all ſervitude and bondage; and partly the Arguments are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that which God will let out for the good of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:47356:212"/>
if mercy and plenteous redemption be with him, then he will redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here fall in upon a general Remark, That folks hopes would be well and diſtinctly grounded, for the Pſalmiſt doth not ſatisfie himſelf to exhort Iſrael to hope in God, but he layes down grounds of hope, on which they are to go in the exerciſe of that Grace; This Point, if I were to ſtand upon it, would give a check, both to the blind gueſſes of the wicked, who have hope enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all that men can ſay, cannot drive them from their carnal confidence, when they cannot tell what their confident hope is, or wherein it is grounded, only they have a blind gueſs, which they take for hope; and partly it would give a check to the children of God, for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctneſs in their hope, and the grounds of it, while they are hanging on God: I do not deny, but when they are oppreſt, they muſt look unto God, to undertake for them; and when they are blind, and cannot ſee through the cloud in the dark day, they muſt grip unto him, who muſt hold them by the right hand, and when they are in a miſt of confuſion, they muſt grip after God. But confuſion and undiſtinctneſs in ordinary, makes much uncomfortable work; whereas if folk ſtudied to be diſtinct and clear in the grounds of their hope, they would not lean ſo little weight on hope, as tentation often perſwades them to do.</p>
            <p>But to leave this, what I would ſay from theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I ſhall draw it to theſe two general Heads; I Ye ſee there is ſomewhat ſupponed here anent them that are put to hope, and who are warranted to hope in God, they are in ſuch a condition, that they are put to need mercy, and plenteous redemption, and that from many iniquities. 2. There is ſomewhat propoſed anent ſuch perſons, that there is hope of mercy and plenteous redemption, for them, with, and in God; and there is Gods power and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to redeem them from all iniquities, and this they are to look to, and hope for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:47356:213"/>For the firſt, That which is ſuppoſed, I ſhall take it up in three Notes; 1. That the man called to hope in God, is miſerable in himſelf, and put out of himſelf, to ſee what is in God that makes for him. 2. That he is not only ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply miſerable, but under a bondage that needs redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and plenteous redemption. 3. That he is a man that above all preſſures he is lying under, finds the preſſure of ſin and guilt to be the greateſt, for he muſt have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Redemption for all his iniquities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The man put to hope, and warranted to hope in God, is a man miſerable in himſelf, and put to look for mercy, he is not a man that is conceity, preſumptuous, dreaming on the account of any good he finds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but he is a man put out of himſelf, to conſider what is in God, <hi>That with God there is mercy.</hi> If I ſhould offer to prove this, by adducing Scripture teſtimony, I ſhould triffle by your time needleſly; it is ſo clear through the tenor of the Scripture, that the rejoicer in Jeſus Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes no confidence in the fleſh, that it is in God, and God alone, that an Iſraelite finds ground of hope; and therefore I rather chooſe to deduce the Point into a twofold inference.</p>
            <p>And 1. From this, be directed to try upon the one hand, your confidence and hope, by your humility, as on the other hand, your humility by your hope, theſe two are inſeparably connected, that the one cannot be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: Upon the one hand, any encouragement that is gotten by Faith and hope, muſt not highten our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of our ſelves; a puffed up hope is a very great Soleciſm; for though thou be helped by hope to glory in God, yet diſcovered infirmity in thy ſelf, will keep thee low; though thou be lifted up by him, thou will be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the duſt in thy ſelf, not to ſee more in thy ſelf, but to ſee more in him to make up thy beggars wants; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt beware that thy confidence and hope leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen thy humility. And on the other hand, thou would
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47356:213"/>
try thy humility, if it be of the right ſtamp, and not a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, proud, carnal diſcouragement; thy humility if it be of the right ſtamp, will not tempt thee to caſt away thy confidence and hope, though thou be ſtill kept low, when thou art diſcovered to be a dyvour and a rebel, thou will not refuſe a pardon, a thing wherein gracious ſouls are much defective, that if they be not kept up in the wind of their attainment, they are broken in their hopes, but a humble man muſt be a hoping man, and muſt reckon that all that he ſees and finds in himſelf, muſt not put him from his hopes; but if he wanted theſe things he finds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſhould have no work for his hope, and bleſſed are they that find humility and hope, encouragement and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement to worke to one anothers hands; when the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs of one of theſe graces lyes towards the furtherance of the other, it is an evidence of a bleſt frame; otherwiſe a proud hope, or a hopeleſs humility, will be found to be of little worth.</p>
            <p>A 2d Inference from the Point is, if Iſrael be called to hope, on the account of what is in God, and with God, if he be called to hope, upon the account of mercy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his miſery, then Iſrael cannot be undone ſo long as there is enough in God to do his turn, but is ſtill to hope; O! may Iſrael ſay, what have I to hope in? Hope ſaith the Pſalmiſt, for there is infinite fulneſs in God, <hi>For with God there is mercy;</hi> Iſrael, ye need not caſt away your hope &amp; confidence, ſo long as there is any thing in God to bottom it. And might I break in here on it, O! what a bleſt communion and ſtocking together (to ſpeak ſo) is there betwixt God and his people; ye know that God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, did always ſhare with his people in all their lots, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted. Zech.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He that touches them, touches the apple of his eye. Jer.</hi> 32.41. <hi>He rejoyceth over them to do them good, with his whole heart and ſoul:</hi> Ye know our bleſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner took on our nature, to ſhare with us in all our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:47356:214"/>
miſeries, <hi>He was tempted in all things, like as we are, but without ſin. Heb.</hi> 4.15. Now he that ſhared once with us in ſuffering, and always in ſympathy, makes a common good of all the fulneſs that is in him for his people, that what he hath, is forthcoming for them; and, O! the rich Promiſes that we have of this; Hath the Father appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a Kingdom, it will do him no good, if they ſhare not in it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29. I <hi>appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my father hath appointed to me, Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> becauſe I live, I will not leave you dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father,</hi> I <hi>will that theſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me where</hi> I <hi>am, that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given me, Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcomes, will I grant to ſit with me on my throne, even as</hi> I <hi>overcame, and am ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, if he have, they ſhall not want; and if it be in God and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, it ſhall not fail; if it be in the houſe among them, it ſhall be forthcoming to Believers, and hopers in God; I pray you learn to reckon this gate, ye cannot tell, what may be your work and exerciſe ere ye go from off the ſtage: and I have no commiſſion to recommend carnal confidence to you; but the Iſrael of God may ſpeak bigg in him, and boaſt their enemies, that ſeing their Head is above the water, though they be doucked they cannot drown; that all the attempts of enemies come now too late to fruſtrat Chriſt's deſigns, unleſs they can bring him back again, and ſet him before their bar.

gotten, he preſently makes it appear in good news to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, he hath an exhortation to them, to hope in the Lord, and hath Motives and Arguments preſſing his Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are taken partly from what is in God, to the behove of his Iſrael, <hi>For with the Lord there is mercy,</hi> &amp;c. And partly from what he will let forth of this for their good and behove; not only is mercy and plenteous redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, but he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. For the Exhortation, I ſpoke to it at length. And at the laſt occaſion I brake in upon the Motives. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to be gathered from which, I reduced to two general Heads. 1. Something ſuppoſed concerning them that are put to hope, and allowed to hope in God. And 2. Something propoſed concerning ſuch as are called and allowed to hope, and as a ground to their hope. For the firſt, That which is ſuppoſed in the Words, it may again be reduced to theſe two Heads of Doctrine; 1. That the man called and allowed to hope in God, is one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with miſery in himſelf, and is put to look out to what is in God, or with him to do his turn: <hi>For with the Lord there is mercy.</hi> That there is mercy with God, implys, That the man that is called, and allowed to hope in God, is in himſelf miſerable, and put to look out to God for mercy; and ſo it is one of the bleſſed and ſure characters of a perſon that is called, and allowed to hope in God, that he is kept humble, not conceity, nor dreaming of any good in himſelf, and the nearer he be to the duſt, he hath the more warrand to hope; for the man that ſpears the right gate to hope, is he that <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Puts his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope;</hi> he creeps low in the duſt to ſeek encouragement to hope; and the man that is called to live by Faith, is oppoſed to the man whoſe ſoul is lifted up in him, and conſequently to the man whoſe heart is not upright in him, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. And further, the man that is called to hope, and allowed to hope, in the humbling ſenſe of his miſery; he is put to look without
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47356:215"/>
himſelf, to what is in God, or with God for him; he is called to hope on the account of mercy, in relation to his miſery. It intimats, that the humble ſenſible man, the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God, can never be undone, ſo long as God is to the fore, and there is enough in him to do his turn, though he be miſerable, and wants that he ſtands in need of; yet if it be in God, he ſhall not want: If mercy be in, and with God, he is made up in the midſt of his miſery. To this I have ſpoken already, and ſhall not repeat.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the ſecond Obſervation, implyed in that which is ſuppoſed, concerning the man that is put to hope, and warranted to hope in God, That not only is he ſimply miſerable, and needing mercy, but he is under ſuch a bondage of ſin and miſery, as he cannot extricat himſelf out of it, except God interpoſe; He needs not only mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in God, but redemption, and plenteous redemption in God, to rid him out of theſe bonds, wherein he is fettered and bound, and out of which he is not able to deliver himſelf; Although the conſideration of ſin will come in to be ſpoken to on the next Obſervation by it ſelf, yet I ſhall on this touch a little in general, both on the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin and miſery, under which the Iſrael of God are ſupponed to be lying. As for ſin, all men by nature are bound ſlaves to it, they are hurried away with every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous blaſt of temptation, that blows upon their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but it is the Iſrael of God that are called and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to hope in God, that feel this bondage. Hence the Apoſtle, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19.) ſaith, <hi>The good that</hi> I <hi>would,</hi> I <hi>do not; but the evil that</hi> I <hi>would not, that</hi> I <hi>do: And he finds a law in his members warring againſt the law of his mind, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him captive to the law of ſin;</hi> on which account, he crys out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> There is a captivity indeed under ſin, and he tells the <hi>Galatians, Chap.</hi> 5.17. <hi>That the fleſh luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe two are contrary, one to another, ſo that they cannot do the things
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47356:216"/>
they would.</hi> So the Iſrael of God are under a bondage of ſin, when they would do good (as the ſame Apoſtle hath it) <hi>ill is preſent with them.</hi> And for the bondage of their miſery, the Scripture is ſo full anent it, and the experience of the Saints ſo amply confirms it, that it is needleſs to ſtand on particular proofs and inſtances of it: How often are they put to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.11. Becauſe they rebelled, therefore he brought down their heart with ſorrow and labour, they fell and there was none to help.</p>
            <p>In the Application of this, I ſhall ſpeak a word, firſt to the wicked and ungodly, and then to Gods Iſrael, who are called and allowed to hope in him, notwithſtanding this bondage they are under: For the firſt, to wit, the wicked, They would from this look on it as a ſad character, to know little, and be as little ſenſible of their bondage through ſin and miſery. They look on a licentious way of living in ſin, when they have eyes full of adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin, as it is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. When ſin reigns in their mortal bodies, and they obey it in the luſts thereof, and they yield their members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. When they give themſelves up to work all uncleanneſs with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. They look upon that as their liberty, and they are never out of bonds, except when they are glutting themſelves with ſin, they ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ep not except they do ill. O! that ſuch knew what a madneſ, and diſtraction they are under, while they glory in their chains, as if a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould glory in his fetters; look to it, aſſure thy ſelf thou ſhalt find ſin to be a bondage, and need of looking to God for Redemption from it, ere thou have a warrand to hope in God. And for the other Branch of this Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Miſery and Trouble, I cannot tell you how many ways wicked men wander in, ere they ſtand in need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption out of it from God, Only I would lead you in a few ſteps of their ill improvement of the miſery they are under through ſin. In one or mo of which, the generality
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:47356:216"/>
may read their Portraict. And 1. It is the wickeds firſt ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> hand to ſecure themſelves againſt all apprehenſions of trouble or miſery; the ſong they would fain eſſay to ſing, is that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.6. <hi>They have ſaid in their heart, they ſhall not be moved;</hi> for they ſhall never be in adverſity, and for that end they foſter their atheiſm, and deny a Providence: Would ye have a character of wicked mens firſt eſſay, ye will find it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. and 9.9. <hi>The Lord ſeeth not, the Lord hath forſaken the earth;</hi> When they would commit all abominations, this is their cordial againſt miſery, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>They are ſettled on their lies, they ſay in their heart, the Lord will neither do good nor evil.</hi> They neither fear him nor his Providence.</p>
            <p>But a 2d. ſtep is this, if they pretend to owne a Deity, and acknowledge a Providence, they will admit of no intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any diſpleaſure from God againſt them, or their way, do what they will: If ye would waken a quarrel, and make them your enemy, tell them God is angry with them for their ſins, and will be about with them, they will be about with you; they dow not endure to be told of their faults, or of God's wrath and anger; I cannot give you this ſtep more diſtinctly, than in that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. When the Prophets ſpoke to them the word of the Lord, they would not let it light, that it was God's minde; They have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied the Lord (ſaith he) and ſaid, it was not he, neither ſhall evil come on us, neither ſhall we ſee ſword or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; What will ye then do with the Prophets, that ſay the contrary? <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>The Prophets ſhall become wind, and the word is not in them:</hi> Thus ſhall it be done to them, they will be in their tops, as wronging God, that tell them of Judgement for their ſins. A 3d ſtep of their wandring, if all this do not the turn, if God fulfil the words of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, they have yet another fend, and it is to grow as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and ſenſeleſs, as they can make themſelves under ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; this ye find deduced, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.25. <hi>The Lord hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47356:217"/>
and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart:</hi> And <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. As the reſult of many a debauſht rant, from the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is ſmitten with ſtupidity, ſtrangers have devoured his ſtrength, and he knows it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there on him, yet he knows not: When vengeance cannot be holden off, the next ſanctuary is ſtupidity. But 4 If ſtupidity will not do the turn, but God will ſmite, and they muſt find it, they will put on a hight and greatneſs of ſpirit, that if any breach come, they will repair it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.9. <hi>There is a generation that ſay in the pride and ſtoutneſs of their heart, the bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewen ſtones;</hi> The ſycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars, when they cannot avoid the feeling of Gods ſtroke, they will ſet to it to make it up. A 5th ſtep of their abuſing, or woful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their miſery and bondage is, if they find that what God hath built, God will throw down, (as it is, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.4. They will run away to their carnal dreams and confidence, that God will owne them, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.4. When great calamity comes upon them, on this very account, they ſay, He may well ſhore, he will not lay on, or if he lay on, he will not ſee us ruined, he will not ſee our laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd. There is yet a 6th ſtep, when all their eſſays miſgive upon their hand; inſtead of taking themſelves to the wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans poſture, to look up to God in the ſenſe of their miſery for redemption, they turn deſperat and hopeleſs, their high flowen carnal expectations, reſolves in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Thou ſaid there is no hope, no, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. <hi>They ſaid there is no hope, but we will walk after our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart;</hi> Their hopes that God will ſpare, reſolves in deſperat hopeleſneſs in the iſſue, like theſe whom <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.12. <hi>The Lord calls to weeping and mourning, to baldneſs and girding with ſackcloth;</hi> They give themſelves to joy and gladneſs,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:47356:217"/>
ſlaying oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we ſhall die.</hi> All theſe ſteps of the wickeds wandring, I have laid before you, that in a brief view, ye may ſee the ſinful byaſſes of folks hearts in their woful way of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the bondage and miſery they are under, that any of you who are delivered from it, may bleſs God and be thankful to him, and may mourn over them that are wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in any of their rods, or over their precipieces.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> ſaid, <hi>I</hi> had alſo ſomewhat to ſay to the Iſrael of God, that are called to hope in God, and allowed and warranted to hope in him, and ſhall briefly touch three or four ſhort words to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When an Iſraelite of God is broght under bondage, from which by no means he can extricat himſelf, but needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from God, he is bound to conſider and reflect on the way how he came there: This is the firſt thing he would think on, how he has ſold himſelf into that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.1. Thus ſaith the Lord, where is the bill of your mothers divorcement, whom <hi>I</hi> have put away? or which of my creditors is it to which <hi>I</hi> have ſold you? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold for your iniquities have ye ſold your ſelves, and for your tranſgreſſions is your mother put away. It is a very uſeful and profitable meditation for them, that find the yoke of their tranſgreſſions wreathed about their neck, to ſit down and conſider how they came thither, how, either by giving way to temptation, preſenting baits to them, have taught it to be their captain, and given it the maſtery over them? or how by their folly and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they have wreathed that yoke on themſelves, from which they cannot rid themſelves, nor get leave to walk haughtily.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An Iſraelite is then called to conſider the holy hand of God, in making him feel the bitter fruit of his folly, in this his bondage. Many not only give way to temptations of ſin, but delight in it, and God leaves them under the power of it till they lament that their folly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:47356:218"/>
when we are under bonds, we would reflect, not only on the bringing of our ſelves in that bondage; but on our delighting in theſe ſins that procured it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſcope of the Point leads me to preſs this, that when an Iſraelite is in miſery, and finds the hand of God purſuing him, he would take another look of things, than to look upon them as inſuperable, though he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede himſelf; yet with God there is redemption, when thou haſt eſſayed to ſhake off the yoke of thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thou haſt wreathed on thy own neck, and haſt laboured in the very fire, and wearied thy ſelf for very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the word is, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.13. Sit not down hopeleſs, look not on thy caſe, as not only deplorable, but deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, call not thy wound grievous, and thy bruiſe incurable, for with God there is plenteous redemption to break theſe bonds, that to thee are inſuperable. Only remember in the 4th place, that thou take the right way to an out-gate; thy bonds will ſit faſt by thee, not only till thou reſent thy folly, in drawing them on, but till thou run to him to ſet thee at liberty; the language of all thy bondage, and the bonds wherewith thou haſt bound thy ſelf, thou may take up in that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.13. when he brought down their heart with labour, and there was none to help; <hi>then they cryed to the Lord in their trouble, and he ſaved them out of their diſtreſſes;</hi> Thou art brought in bondage through thy folly, thou uſes means to be out of it, but thy difficulties continue inſuperable, every eſſay thou makes to be quit of them, miſcarries; but ſee that it be not becauſe thou art not at the right door with them, no marvail they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till thou come to him, with whom is plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. So much for the 2d Point, That the man put and allowed to hope in God, is under ſuch a bondage of ſin and miſery, as he cannot extricat himſelf out of it, till God interpoſe and redeem him.</p>
            <p>The 3d Obſervation implyed in that which is ſuppoſed here, anent hopers in God, is that of all bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:47356:218"/>
the bondage of ſin is the greateſt to the Iſrael of God, to the man that is called and allowed to hope in God. On this account it is, that the Pſalmiſt doth not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſay, <hi>There is plenteous redemption with God</hi> in the general; but there muſt be a particular Promiſe ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his Iniquities.</hi> That there be redemption in and with God, will not content an Iſraelite, except there be in it a redemption from ſin; becauſe redemption from ſin is Iſrael's great buſineſs and affair, I ſhall not need to confirm the truth of this, either from Scripture proofs or inſtances, where we find the Saints eſpecially troubled with ſin; amongſt the croud of their exerciſes, ſin hath been their great exerciſe. Nor ſhall I need to ſtand to give reaſons of the Point, as that ſin is the greateſt evil, the fountain whence all our miſery and bondage flows; and they that ſeek relief from their bondage, without ſeeking redemption from ſin, are like theſe that ſeek to dry up the ſtream, miskenning the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But paſſing theſe, I ſhall ſpeak a word, firſt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and then in particular, to the Iſrael of God, how ſin is taken up by an Iſraelite, in a right frame, as the greateſt bondage and ſlavery.</p>
            <p>In general, I recommend more conſcience making of ſin, and more exerciſe about ſin, a thing, I fear, little in practice amongſt the generality; ye will get men in times of difficulty, with their hands on their loins, having pangs, and crying out, as a woman in travail, by reaſon of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, who will have very few thoughts of ſin, and leſs exerciſe about it; there is oft times much trembling of mind, where there is little trouble of conſcience, or none, and ye would beware of confounding theſe two. A mans mind may be troubled and confounded, and put through other, when he hath the anſwer of a good Conſcience, as being at peace with God through the blood of Chriſt, and a mans mind may be troubled, when his conſcience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and hath no exerciſe for ſin; and therefore in times
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:47356:219"/>
when there may be much anxiety and vexation in folks mind, about diſpenſations of Providence, let not the great buſineſs be trouble, but ſin, and whatever ye meet with, take that along with you, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin;</hi> The conſcience of ſin, and exerciſe about it, would take away the clamour &amp; di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that's about trouble, a conſcience troubled about ſin, will ſoon juſtifie God, in inflicting any trouble on body or mind, and will ſay as <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. <hi>Thou haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi> And a man at peace with God, though he have tribulation in the world, and exerciſe of Conſcience for ſin, yet in Chriſt he ſhall have peace; but a vexed and diſcontented mind about trouble, without any exerciſe or trouble of conſcience for ſin, may make a man evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to himſelf, &amp; bad enough company to others whom he hath to do with in the world.</p>

So there is no undertaking, that the ſaints may have more encouragement for than to hope in God; it is that which many times comes between them and ſinking, and giving it over, as in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in me, hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him;</hi> and whereas the world may think the hope of the Saints a blind gueſs, and ſay of their ſouls, there is no help for them in God, and temptation within, or probability with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, may confirm, or ſeem to confirm the worlds verdict;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:47356:219"/>
yet to a right diſcerner, it hath a fair field to go on, and a broad board to feed on, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am yet (as ye may remember) detained on ſome truths imported here, concerning right hopes in God: As 1. That on the account of emptineſs and miſery at home, they are left upon God, with whom there is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 2. That upon the account of bondage and preſſures, from which they are not able to extricat themſelves, they are left on God, with whom is plenteous redemption. And 3. That among all the preſſures neceſſitating them to look to God for Redemption; There is none pinches them ſo hard, and ſticks ſo cloſe to them, as ſin, ſo that there is need of a particular Promiſe of redemption from that.</p>
            <p>I left in the morning with a general word from the laſt of theſe, That ſin, and the bondage we are under through ſin, ſhould be more our exerciſe, we ſhould ſilence all cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors about trouble, with being throng about guilt, that we ſhould look on troubles and afflictions, as things that we may get home with, whether we be rid of them or not; but we ſhould look on redemption from ſin, as a thing abſolutly neceſſar, <hi>For without holineſs, none ſhall ſee God;</hi> and that we ſhould not take every trouble of mind, for kindly exerciſe of Conſcience for ſin, we ſhould not let Conſcience be ſleeping in the boſom of a <hi>Delilah,</hi> while there is a clamour made about trouble, and that becauſe it will not be ſuffered to ſleep there without interruption. Now to follow out this a little more particularly, I ſhall offer you four or five words from the Text, about their right exerciſe, whoſe trouble is about ſin, or ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of them who have ground of hope, that God will redeem them from all iniquity.</p>
            <p>And 1. (which is more general) they that would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to God, in their exerciſe about ſin, muſt learn to look on ſin as a burden, whereof they would be rid, as a bondage from which they need redemption, In
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:47356:220"/>
the right Iſrael of God, that is rightly exerciſed about ſin, no grievance goes ſo near the heart, as that of ſin. The want of a delivery from trouble, if they could be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſinning under it, or from having their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on irritat to ſin more by it, it would be to them an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and they would drink and forget their miſery, if they could get ſin ſhaken off, if they could get that weight laid aſide, and be made light <hi>to run the race that is ſet before them;</hi> What will ye ſay to this, ye to whom wickedneſs is ſweet, and who hide it under your tongue, who ſpare ſin, and forſake it not, who count it not a bondage, but a liberty; ſurely to a true Iſraelite ſin is the moſt unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burden.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They that look aright on ſin, as on a burden where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they would be rid, they muſt look on it as an iniquity, abominable and hateful, <hi>He ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities;</hi> and as the phraſe is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> Some ſins may be troubleſom or vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious, and folk would not care to be quit of them, on that, or ſome other carnal account; but there is none right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed with ſin, that do not weary of it, as hateful, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, and ugly in God's Eyes. Thou may deſire to be quit of one ſin, becauſe it cruſheth another ſin, but that is no evidence of a right groaning under the preſſure of iniquity till it be groaned under as loathſom to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As they that are rightly exerciſed about ſin, look on it as a burden, and as iniquity; ſo all of it is hateful and abominable as ſuch; I might here, if I would follow it out, point out to you, that there is an <hi>all</hi> of ſin in every one of mankind, that there is an all of ſin even in Iſrael, who are allowed to hope in God, a notion that <hi>David</hi> notices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.12. <hi>Mine iniquities have taken hold on me ſo that I cannot look up, they are more than the hairs of mine head.</hi> And O, but they that are well acquaint with their own heart, that are often upon a ſelf-examination and ſearch, and do not live ſtrangers to themſelves, they will
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:47356:220"/>
find greater and greater abominations there. Whither do they turn them, but they will find pollutions in their omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and commiſſions, in reference both to Law and Goſpel, in reference to mercies received, and corrections inflicted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which <hi>I</hi> am upon is, That Iſrael looks upon all ſin as iniquity. A partial oppoſition of ſin, is a ſelf-deceiving undertaking, a ſacrificing of many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful delights to one predominant, a burning of many Cities, to ſave one <hi>Zoar,</hi> will not be taken off ſaints hands, as a right oppoſition of ſin. As far as iniquity extends, ſo far muſt their groaning under, and oppoſition to it extend.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They that are rightly exerciſed about ſin, will find it a preſſure that needs a redemption, that is a preſſure that they'l not get ſhaken off till God interpoſe. There is ſome other thing in delivery from iniquity, than for a man to think he will go forth as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and ſhake him as at other times. No, a man will be put to look to God to attain it. I confeſs, painfulneſs in the uſe of means is our duty, and it will never be taken off our hands, for us to ſay, that iniquity is our burden, and hurtful to us, ſo long as we are not uſing means to be rid of it. No, there muſt be endeavours on our part to caſt out theſe Devils by Faſting and Prayer; and though it were to <hi>beat down the body, and bring it in ſubjection</hi> (as the Apoſtle does, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.) in the exerciſe of Mortification, that muſt not be wanting; but it fears me, there is little of the painful work of Mortification to be found among Chriſtians in thoſe days, profeſſion is the broadeſt thing in Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all, and next to that ſome poſitive duties; but for the ſerious ſtudy of Mortification, to get Satan trode un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, to be above corruption: O! how few Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans can have a ſober teſtimony on that account? And yet ſhall I ſay it, that next to thy cloſing with Chriſt, and making him thy City of Refuge, thy painfulneſs in Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication will be thy great Teſt? But that which I am now
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:47356:221"/>
on, is to lay before you, that on the one hand, ſlipt in Mortification (I had almoſt ſaid ſleeped in Mortification) of ſin, is much to be ſuſpected, when ſome iniquities that had power over you ſeem to be ſubdued, but ye never did any thing to ſubdue them: ye would remember that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43. of the unclean ſpirit that goes out of a man; many Devils go out, that are not caſten out; that is, he withdraws to take the man from off his watch, and to ſurprize him, to put himſelf in a capacity to <hi>return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his houſe whence he came out, with ſeven other spirits more wicked than himſelf.</hi> But further, as ſlipt in Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, will not hold water; ſo on the other hand, when we have uſed all pains to mortifie and ſubdue ſin, our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will not prove effectual, though Prayer and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting be our duty, and the uſe of other means, till God come and give redemption from it. It is God only that hath power over iniquity; yea, it may be, that he hath a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial hand in it, and hath paſt a ſentence, making it thy plague as well as thy ſin, that till thou know the plague of thine own heart, and look up to him for delivery from it as a plague, thou ſhalt not be rid of it. And therefore, as on the one hand thou muſt be at pains to get the burden and bondage of ſin ſhaken off, that <hi>Naphthali</hi> may be a Hind let looſe; ſo on the other hand, thou muſt not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, though thy pains be not effectual as to that thing, but remember, though when thou haſt done all thou can, thou cannot rid thy ſelf of iniquity, and it will be with thee; he in whom thou art called, and allowed to hope, can deliver thee.</p>
            <p>But 5. Iniquity being a burden and bondage, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and hateful to the true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and the wreſtler, to be free of it, finding that he cannot get himſelf rid of it. God interpoſing to redeem from it, is a peculiar mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: That's a proof that with him is plenteous redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he redeem him from iniquity. This is the main
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:47356:221"/>
point, and a point that I cannot enough batter on you; Redemption from iniquity to a right diſcerner, will make up all redemptions. Let a man be a ſervant, a ſlave, a bond-man, a worm, and not a man, he is the Lords free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if he be redeemed from iniquity. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.2. Then <hi>the inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick: the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> It's a noble Phyſick for ſickneſs to be a pardoned man, it's a noble antidot to all preſſures, to be redeemed from iniquity; it compenſes and makes more than up all other preſſures, to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this preſſure. And as this redemption makes up all other redemptions, ſo other redemptions without this, will ſignifie little to a right diſcerner, this to him is the choice of mercies; let God caſt him in trouble, and bring him out of trouble, if he bring him not from the bondage of iniquity, it's no delivery to him; if when he is caſt into the furnace his ſkum depart not from him, but he brings it out with him; he can ſee a plague in other redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the bondage of ſin continues. In a word, to the right diſcerner of the bondage of ſin, God is a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God to him on this very account, that he <hi>pardons ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage;</hi> a place, which with others I had occaſion to make uſe of, in ſpeaking on the 4. <hi>verſe:</hi> And whoever are complaining of preſſures, and ſeeking to be rid of them, &amp; yet they continue, if ye would read the language of that diſpenſation aright, here it is, God is making that preſſure to ly on; till redemption from ſin be lookt on as the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mercy, which if we enjoy, we cannot be miſerable; and if we want it, have what we will, we cannot be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Mind this mercy more, redemption from iniquity, to humble uncircumciſed hearts, to be groaning under the bondage of ſin, longing for delivery from that woful Trade of walking contrary to God, and provocking him to walk contrary to you, and to puniſh you ſeven times more, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:47356:222"/>
ſeven times more, till ye be humbled, and take with the chaſtiſement of your iniquity. Remember I have left it with you in the Name of the Lord, that there be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience making of ſin, and of being exerciſed mainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and putting God to redeem you from it; let this be your great taſk and exerciſe, whatever be your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe otherwiſe. Now I have done with that which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the motives backing the Exhortation to hope in God.</p>
            <p>I come then to that which is propoſed, to encourage to hope in God: And I ſuppoſe the reſt of the Doctrines in theſe two Verſes may be diſtinctly enough reduced to theſe four. 1. That relative to <hi>Iſraels</hi> miſery, <hi>There is mercy in God, or with him.</hi> 2. That relative to <hi>Iſraels</hi> bondage, <hi>There is plenteous redemption with God.</hi> 3. That what is with God, ſhall be put forth as the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God needeth it: <hi>Redemption is with him, and he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deem,</hi> &amp;c. 4. We ſhall ſpeak a little to this redemption from iniquity, how God works it?</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it may thus be taken up, that it is a great encouragement to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to hope in God, in all caſes and exigents, that there is mercy with God. This mercy of God is in effect the goodneſs of God, that Attribute of God which ye have in your Catechiſm. It's the goodneſs of God, I ſay, expreſt under a notion relative to the miſery of man, and ſo ye have it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.1. <hi>O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.</hi> How is that evidenced? <hi>for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever.</hi> He who is good in himſelf, and doth good to others, as <hi>David</hi> hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68. He is good, and manifeſts his goodneſs, by doing good to othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, by his mercy that endures for ever. Not to inſiſt on the various notions and expreſſions of this goodneſs of God, if we look to it in the fountain, his goodneſs, as it is communicate to his creatures, is called his love, and his goodneſs in the fountain is called his love, becauſe it's an eminent proof
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:47356:222"/>
of his goodneſs, that he <hi>loves with an everlaſting love,</hi> Jer. 31.3. That he hath a love to his people, wherein he will reſt, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. That he hath ſuch a love to them, as nothing ſhall ſeparate from; and partly becauſe he doth not beſtow this his goodneſs grudgingly, or complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but in love: Love ſtretcheth out the hand of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. He rejoyceth over them to do them good, with his whole heart, and with his whole ſoul. Again, is the goodneſs of God in its root and fountain, is called the love of God to his people, ſo in reſpect of its freedom, and their ill-deſerving to partake of it. It's called the grace of God, a term that we find frequently occurring in Scripture, and it's nothing elſe but the goodneſs of God, or the effects of his goodneſs freely communicat, freely beſtowed, without money or price, where there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or deſerving, yea, where there is much undeſerving, or deſerving of the contrary. Again, this goodneſs of God, as it is manifeſted in oppoſition to the waywardneſs and peeviſhneſs of his people, it is called patience and long-ſuffering; for his patience, in waiting on them, and his long-ſuffering, in bearing with their manners in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, what is it but the goodneſs of God, overcoming the waywardneſs and peeviſh diſpoſition in his people? Again, the goodneſs of God, as it is ſtill continued, even when Juſtice and Severity takes place, it's called Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Moderation, that in meaſure when it ſhutteth forth, he debateth with it, and <hi>ſtayth his rough wind in the day of his eaſt wind,</hi> Iſai. 27.8. And that <hi>in wrath he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mercy,</hi> Hab. 3.2. There the goodneſs of God mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating deſerved ſtroaks, droping in proofs of love, in the midſt of deſerved wrath, all theſe are the goodneſs of God repreſented to us under various notions; and here in the Text, the goodneſs of God in reference to his peoples miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is called mercy. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. When the Lord proclaims his Name in <hi>Moſes</hi> hearing, ye will find there
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:47356:223"/>
are various notions of the goodneſs of God that I have been ſpeaking of, and in the ſame method. The firſt Letter of his Name is <hi>Merciful,</hi> to nominat that the firſt look that God takes of poor man, is pity and compaſſion, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his miſery. The next Letter is <hi>Gracious,</hi> to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that God having lookt on miſerable man, as the obje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of his compaſſion, becauſe it might be objected, God hath great compaſſion, but what deſerves miſerable man? He hath nothing to commend him, yea, he hath much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him. It is anſwered, God is not only merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to compaſſionat miſerable man, but he is gracious to notice him, and compaſſionat him freely, without merit, and contrary to demerit. Then he is <hi>Long ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. Now in reference to this mercy of God, there are three things I intend to touch on, before I come to the uſe. 1. To open up the nature of this mercy. 2. To ſpeak a little of the object of it. And 3. to the properties of it.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to the firſt, I ſhall wave all School ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations anent it, as whether mercy and punitive juſtice be eſſential to God, and on what account they can be called eſſential Attributes, ſeing mercy preſuppoſes man miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which is one of the <hi>Socinian</hi> foundations, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; but that might be eaſily cleared, by adding a word to what hath been already ſaid, That mercy in God is nothing but the goodneſs of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with relation to the object to which it is communicat, and punitive juſtice is nothing elſe but that eſſential Attribute of his holineſs, vindicating and avenging himſelf on a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the object of his juſtice; and if we conſider the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and juſtice of God thus; we will find it no difficulty to rank them among the eſſential Attributes of God, yea, that it is blaſphemy to deny them to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>I thought to have cleared to you, how that mercy is no paſſion nor perturbation in God, as it is in man, though it be, for our encouragment to hope in him, expreſt in moſt
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:47356:223"/>
pathetick terms; as alſo to have cleared, That the Earth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s full of his Mercy and Goodneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5. All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhare in it; yet there are veſſels of mercy afore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared to glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. That are objects of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial mercy; and to have ſpoken to its properties, how it is real and not complementing; How he delights in mercy, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. How it is free, eternal, ſure and rich for all neceſſities. But for want of time I forbear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend you and what ye have heard, to His bleſſing, whoſe word it is.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THough when a look is taken of God's Iſrael, none are more low and empty in themſelves, none that claim greater acquaintance with the duſt, than they are enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to do; yet none have ſuch ample ground of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement as they, if they be Iſrael: thogh they be in miſery and under bondage and particularly oppreſſed with, and under the bondage of ſin, yet Iſrael is ſtill allowed, and commanded to hope in God; and that becauſe Iſrael's wealth and happineſs, and the ground of his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is without himſelf. Though he be poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks on him, though he have nothing, in God he poſſeſſeth all things; <hi>Though his houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> yet his ſalvation and deſire lies in this, <hi>That God hath made with him an everlaſting covenant, well ordered in all things and ſure;</hi> And in a word, have what he will, or be what he will in himſelf, yet he may hope in God, conſidering what is with God, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken from this argument, preſſing hope in God, to what is imported in it, as to the hopers conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:47356:224"/>
that he is indigent and miſerable in himſelf, needing to look for mercy in God; that he is in bondage, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look for plenteous redemption with God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that he is under the bondage of iniquity, which puts him to look for a particular redemption from that from him, that redeems Iſrael from all his iniquities. And the laſt day I came to break in on what is propoſed in the words for Iſrael's encouragement to hope in God. The firſt Obſervation of four, which <hi>I</hi> could ſcarce break in on was, That it is the great encouragement of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hope in him in all exigents and caſes, that there is mercy with God, that they have to do with a God, with whom there is mercy: This mercy (as <hi>I</hi> then cleared) is nothing elſe but the goodneſs of God (and conſequently an eſſential attribute) relating to the miſery of the object to which it is communicat, even as his punitive Juſtice is an eſſential Attribute, being nothing elſe but his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, manifeſting it ſelf againſt ſin; for as the goodneſs of God undergoes various notions, on divers accounts (as was ſaid) ſo it hath the name of mercy, with relation to the miſery of man.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting of this, I proponed to ſpeak 1. more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to the nature of this mercy. 2. To the Object. To the Properties. And 4. Of the uſe of the whole.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, the nature of this Mercy, 1. It muſt be fixed; that this mercy is free of all paſſion, or perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in God. When we conſider God as merciful, we muſt not conceive of him as of one ſubject to the paſſions of grief or ſorrow, for the miſery of others, as mercy in man is to be conſidered; and therefore mercy in men uſed to be condemned by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as being in their opinion, a debaſing of the ſpirit of man, below the hight and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that it ought to have; and it is reported of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> that he ſaid, it was difficult for a man, both to be merciful and wiſe at once, becauſe if he were merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it would be ready to tranſport him to that which was
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:47356:224"/>
not ſuitable to a wiſe man, but we have nothing to do with that debate here. Mercy in God is free of paſſion or perturbation, of ſorrow or grief for others miſery, as it is in creatures, it is only the goodneſs of God willing to remove, allay, or ſweeten the miſery of others, only though God in his mercy be free of paſſion, or perturbation, yet he ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, allays, or removes the miſery of man, as tenderly and carefully as if he were affected with it. Therefore for our capacity, and better uptaking of it, the mercy of God is ſpoken of as very paſſionat, affecting and tranſporting in him, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.9. He is ſpoken of, as being <hi>afflicted in all the afflictions of his people. Zech.</hi> 2.8. as being <hi>touched on the apple of his eye, when they are touched. Jud.</hi> 10.16. as having <hi>his ſoul grieved,</hi> or ſhortned in his reſolution to puniſh, when he looked on his peoples miſery. And <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. As being put to a very great perplexity about them. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? How ſhall</hi> I <hi>deliver thee, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael? How ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</hi> All which terms are borrowed to ſhew, that however God in ſhewing mercy, be free of paſſion or perturbation, yet is he no leſs tender and careful in ſhewing mercy, than if theſe paſſions abounded in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to be conſidered, that it is to be wondered, that he ſhould be merciful, when none of theſe things are in him, that prompts men to be merciful; all his mercy we owe to his goodneſs allanerly. Men are prompted to be merciful to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they are of the ſame nature with them. Beſide that, weakneſs and ſoftneſs of ſpirit that is in ſome, may make them compaſſionat others in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The experience others have had of ſuch preſſures, may excite compaſſion to others in the like caſe; mens relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may warm and affect their hearts with compaſſion to their relations in miſery, when yet they will be leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned how it fares with others not ſo related to them, and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:47356:225"/>
men conſidering not ſo much the ſimple trouble, as the age &amp; dignity of the perſons troubled when they ſee ſuch in trouble, it may waken compaſſion. But all theſe are far removed from the Majeſty of God, he is infinitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and infinitly diſtinct from man's nature; neither is his nature ſubject to Miſery; yet he is no leſs merciful, but infinitly more merciful, than if all theſe things that ſerve to excite mercy in men were in him.</p>
            <p>Only 3. Take one word more concerning this mercy that is with God in general, becauſe it is not ſo eaſy as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think to take up this mercy in an infinit and glorious Spirit: He hath been pleaſed to bring this mercy in him a little nearer to us, and to take up his dwelling in our nature, in giving the Son of his Love to be incarnat, and our kinſman, <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> experiencing the miſery of man, that his mercy may run through this channel, that his infinit mercy may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to us, through the tender bowels of a merciful and faithful high Prieſt, who was in all things made like to his brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>And who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and was in all things tempted as we are, yet without ſin, Heb.</hi> 4.15. To aſſure us that he can be touched with our miſeries.</p>
            <p>But I proceed in the 2d place, to ſpeak to the Object of this mercy in God; and here in general, all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, do in ſome meaſure partake of this mercy of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>His tender mercies are over all his works,</hi> or upon all his works, as the word will read, or to be ſeen in all his works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5. <hi>The earth is full of the goodneſs of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 119.64, <hi>The earth is full of his mercy,</hi> his mercy is extended to the very ravenous birds and beaſts, whoſe needy crys are lookt on as directed to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, <hi>Job.</hi> 38.41. <hi>He provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto him, Pſal.</hi> 104.21. <hi>The young lions roar after their prey, and ſeek their meat from God. Pſal.</hi> 147.9. <hi>He giveth to the beaſt his food, and to the young ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:47356:225"/>
which cry, Joel</hi> 1.20. In time of drought, the beaſts of the field cry unto him. And <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. God reſpects not only the infants that were in <hi>Niniveh,</hi> who knew not the right hand by the left, but the very cattel; and if beaſts partake of the mercy of God, then wicked men are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.35. He is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. and the commentary put on this, <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>Be ye therefore merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful.</hi> The viſible Church, they yet more peculiarly are the object of Gods mercy, as witneſs all the promiſes made to Iſrael of old, for the elects ſake that were among them; But the moſt peculiar objects of his mercy, are his own elect, who (as ye heard, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23.) are veſſels of mercy, which he hath afore prepared to glory; His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards them cannot be enumerated. The mercy of their Election, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. <hi>He hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> compaſſion on him, on whom he will have compaſſion, It is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of him that ſheweth mercy, No, but election may be called, and is an act of Dominion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity; yet its ſcope is mercy. Then there is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration,</hi> &amp;c. And being regenerat, what a heap of mercy and goodneſs follows them all their days, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. The mercy of pardoning their iniquity. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. The mercy of hearing their prayers, as he ſayes in another caſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.27. <hi>When he ſhall cry unto me, I will hear, for I am gracious.</hi> The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of moderation in the midſt of wrath, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. And not to enumerat all the mercies conferred on the ſaints, the conſummation of their mercies, lies in their everlaſting happineſs, <hi>Jude verſe</hi> 20 <hi>Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life;</hi> Then they will get that Prayer anſwered, put up in the behalf of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord grant that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> Thus the Elect from Election to eternal Glorification are
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:47356:226"/>
the objects of Gods peculiar mercy. I ſhall only in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the object of this mercy in God, deſire you further to take notice, under what notions the godly are deſcribed, when he promiſes to expreſs his mercy to them, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it to them, he is merciful to them, becauſe they are his own elect; yet ye may notice theſe names and notions under which mercy is holden out and enſured to them, and I ſhall name four or five.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are deſcribed as penitents bemoaning their ſin, and turning from their evil way, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. When <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> is bemoaning himſelf, crying, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> and repenting, then it follows, I <hi>will ſurely have mercy on him.</hi> An impenitent poſture may obſtruct mercy in its effects, from coming to a godly man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Objects of this Mercy are deſcribed to be lovers of him, &amp; keepers of his commands, as in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Shewing mercy to thouſands of them that love me,</hi> &amp;c. It is not ſimply to keepers of the commands, but to ſuch as keep them from a principle of love; neglected obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or obedience not from a principle of love, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the manifeſtations of mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The objects of this ſpecial mercy, are deſcribed to be fearers of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 1.50. <hi>His mercy is upon them that fear him from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation.</hi> A heart ſtanding in awe of God, a man that hath all his performances, and even his love ſeaſoned with fear, is the man that is under the drop of Mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Objects of this peculiar Mercy, are deſcribed to be merciful folk, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Bleſt are the merciful for they ſhall obtain mercy:</hi> They that have obtained mercy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cannot but have merciful bowels to deal about them, according to their ability, and as there is cauſe: and a cruel unmerciful diſpoſition is a ſhrewd token that ſuch
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:47356:226"/>
an one has not obtained mercy. But more of this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, The Objects of this Mercy are deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be tender walkers, according to the Rule and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſet before them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy.</hi> Their tender walk puts them not without Mercies miſter. The more tender they are in their walk, they ſee the more need of mercy, and this keeps them under the drop of mercy. So much for the Object of this Mercy that is with God, and for the characters of them to whom it is expreſt, which would be looked to by all of you, who would be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it.</p>
            <p>I proceed now in the 3d place, to ſpeak to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Mercy, which will help to unfold the nature of it a little more diſtinctly; and among all the Properties that might be aſſigned to it; a little briefly to theſe five.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This would be fixed, that the mercy of God is a real mercy. Ye will get fair weather and complemental mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy enough in the World; mercy profeſſed where it is not, and where it kythes not in any effect, ye will get mercy enough like that, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15. When a brother or ſiſter is naked, or deſtitute of daily food, men that will ſay to them <hi>depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled,</hi> but they give them nothing needful for the body. The whole world (as one ſays) are like Hiſtrionicks counterfeit, masked perſons, and in nothing more than in their pretences and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mercy; but the mercy of God is a real mercy, a mercy that folk may lippen to; if ye enquire for it in the inward affection, what can be required, but it is adduced to expreſs it? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 23.15. It is expreſt by ſounding of the bowels, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. By bowels being troubled or mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. By the turning of the heart within, and repentings kindled together: All theſe expreſſions are to point out, how cordial and real the Lord is, as to the inward affection of mercy; and for the Effects of it, men
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:47356:227"/>
want rather eyes to diſcern them, than the mercies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Even his own people are ſtraitned in their own bowels, how to keep the proofs of mercy, when his heart is enlarged to beſtow them, and yet they never want a proof of his mercy, while they have a room in the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of his Heart, and Faith to believe that they are in the Hoſpital of his Compaſſion, that is an evident proof how real his mercy is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As his mercy is real, ſo the Scripture tells, it is that wherein he delights, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>He retains not his anger for ever.</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe he delights in mercy:</hi> No, but he delights in himſelf and in all his Attributes, and in the manifeſtation of them in the World, but in a peculiar manner in his mercy upon divers accounts. He may be ſaid to delight in it, partly on the account of the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his merciful diſpenſations and manifeſtations, in acts of mercy. For works of Judgment towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are his Work, his ſtrange Work, and his Act, his ſtrange Act. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.21. <hi>But the earth is full of the goodneſs of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 35.5. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, to ſuch as keep his covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. Again, he delights in mercy, becauſe there is nothing flows from him, but that which may invite, &amp; not hinder ſinners from coming to him, &amp; being objects of his mercy. It is true, he willeth the death of ſinners for ſin, to glorifie his Juſtice; Yet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. <hi>He hath no pleaſure at all in the death of him that dieth, but rather that he ſhould return from his ways and live.</hi> Nothing flows from him to ſeclude any from his mercy, that will not ſeclude themſelves, even when he ſtrikes, it is to drive to his mercy, when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, the language is, <hi>Turn you and live, why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Again, he delights in mercy, becauſe all the good he doth to his people, he doth it not grudgingly. Many a good turn among men is (as ye ſpeak (ſpilt in the doing: But the good that he does to his people, he does it with his whole heart and ſoul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. He acts
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:47356:227"/>
mercy toward his people (to ſpeak ſo) as one in his own Element, and as going about a work that is kindly to him, if I may ſo word it. And laſtly, he delights in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, becauſe (to ſpeak after the manner of men) he hath no pleaſure that his people ſhould ever raiſe any cloud betwixt his mercy and them; the people of God cannot do themſelves a greater wrong, nor him a greater unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (if ye underſtand it aright) than by their provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to incapacitat him, to manifeſt his mercy towards them; But miſtake not this, for he hath a Soveraignty in his grace, even when they in a manner neceſſitat him, to keep up the acts of his mercy, and to afflict them; hence when they go onfrowardly in the way of their own heart, his tender mercy will make a ſtepping-ſtone of impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are put in its way, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.17. Becauſe he delights in mercy, he will come over all theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to do them a good turn freely.</p>
            <p>And that is a 3d property of this mercy, it is a free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it is a mercy beſtowed without money, and without price; But this (as I told you the laſt day) is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the notion of Grace, that is imported in the Goodneſs of God, in that it is freely given. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, compaſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it's not in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that ſhews mercy;</hi> There is no place for diſputing here, Why? he will have mercy on ſuch and ſuch, and not on others; it is an act of his royal prerogative in grace, that none can hinder, for who can hinder him to do with his own what he will.</p>
            <p>A 4th Property of this mercy with God is, That it is an eternal mercy; I do not mean, that any creature that gets not an Intereſt in the mercy of God, in this life, may look to be partaker of it after this life, that was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Origen</hi> that Devils and damned men and women ſhould at length ſhare in the mercy of God. Either thou
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:47356:228"/>
muſt grip mercy here, or thou haſt done with it eternally. But to them that cloſe with mercy here, it is an everlaſting mercy. Hence is that over-word of the 136. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> His mercy endureth for ever; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>His mercy is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him;</hi> from election to their eternal glorification; ſo <hi>David</hi> finds that his tender mercies and loving kindneſſes have been for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of old. And the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23. finds, <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that they are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fails not.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſings, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 23.6. <hi>Surely goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my life.</hi> It is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and eternal mercy.</p>
            <p>There is a 5th property <hi>I</hi> intended to have ſpoken to, and that is the fulneſs and riches of this mercy; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am to ſpeak a little more to that, I ſhall leave it, and the Uſe of the whole Doctrine to the afternoon. <hi>God bleſs his word unto you.</hi>

            <p>WHen ſome time is ſpent in ſpeaking of the Mercy of God, we are very far from ſowing pillows to the Armholes, or from making Kercheffs to the heads of the ſecure; although I confeſs many do break their necks upon this bleſſed refuge of God's mercy, and it will be their double condemnation, that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodneſs of God, that ſhould have led them to repentance, was an occaſion of their hardning in miſchief. Conſider but the Scriptures deſign, in ſpeaking of that mercy that is with God, that it is partly to leave Rebels, and Wanderers without excuſe, when mercy is in their offer, and they will have none of it. And partly and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to be the great cordial of the miſerable man, who
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:47356:228"/>
when he is under all preſſures that are ready to ſink him, hath this for his refuge, that <hi>with God there is mercy,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. who when he is troubled with ſoul-perplexities and deſertion, with apprehenſions of being cut off, and that his enemies ſhould inſult over him, hath this for his cordial, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>But I have truſted in thy mercy;</hi> and the ſweet reſult of that is added, <hi>My heart ſhall rejoice in thy ſalvation:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, becauſe he hath dealt bountifully with me:</hi> that will be the ſweet iſſue of the miſterful mans truſting in Gods mercy.</p>
            <p>Now ye have heard ſomewhat of the nature of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in general, ſomewhat of the peculiar objects of it, and under what names and notions mercy is holden out, and enſured to the godly man: I have alſo ſpoken ſomewhat of the properties of this mercy, that it is a real mercy, that wherein God delights, and that it is free and eternal; and before I come to the uſe, I am to ſpeak a little to the fifth.</p>
            <p>A 5th property then of mercy with God is, that it is a rich, full, and infinite mercy, a mercy to reach all the miſeries and needs of his people; as to the riches and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mercy, the Scripture very plenteouſly ſpeaks of it, it is ſaid of God, that he is <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.4. He is ſaid to be <hi>plentiful in mercy, and full of compaſſion,</hi> Pſal. 86.5. <hi>His mercies are manifold mercies,</hi> Neh. 9.19. So they are called <hi>great mercies,</hi> Neh. 9.31. Pſal. 119.156. Iſa. 54 7. And <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. It's great mercy that Uſhers in a ſupplication, <hi>we do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our own righteouſneſs, but for thy great mercies,</hi> It is ſaid further, that he hath not only tender mercies, that are very compaſſionat and condeſcending, but he hath a <hi>multitude of tender mercies,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. Pſal. 69.16. He is ſaid to have abundant mercies, in that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. He hath mercies in ſuch abundance, that they are infinitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the mercies of man, when <hi>David</hi> had it in his choice,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:47356:229"/>
whether he would <hi>have three years famine, or three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths fleeing before the enemy, or three days peſtilence,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.14. <hi>Let us now fall</hi> (ſaih he) <hi>into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great, and let us not fall into the hand of man.</hi> And to add no more, it is ſaid of Gods mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.4. That <hi>he crowns us with his tender mercies,</hi> &amp;c. That is, partly he ſurrounds his people with proofs of love on every hand, as a Crown compaſſeth the head, that they cannot turn them about, but <hi>mercy compaſſeth them about as with a ſhield,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.12. And partly, his mercies put reſpect and honour on his people, as if they ſet a Crown on every Saints head, and made them <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.35. <hi>Thy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath made me great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have let you ſee how copiouſly the Scripture ſpeaks of the fulneſs and richneſs of this mercy, and that <hi>I</hi> may let you ſee it in ſome particular evidences and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the mercy of God toward his people, is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to pity them, when no eye pities them, when they are the object of contempt and abhorrency, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 when they are caſt out into the open field, lying polluted in their blood, having no eye to pity them, then it is a time of love, and he ſaith to them, Live, and he ſpreads his ſkirt over them; that is rich mercy, to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of the earth, and make them the objects of his ſpecial mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His mercy is full and rich, in giving a vent to it ſelf, even when he is letting out ſeverity, his mercy manifeſts it ſelf, even when he lifts up his hand, and is ſtriking, in inviting them whom he ſtrikes, to turn, that they die not, as <hi>Job</hi> 10. when he is deſtroying him, as he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, after he hath enumerat ſome common providences about him, he ſays, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Theſe things thou haſt hid in thy heart, I know that this is with thee, I know there
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:47356:229"/>
is ſome other thing in thy heart, than what I can read in thy dealing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The riches and fulneſs of this mercy appears in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying and paſſing by the peeviſhneſs and waywardneſs of his people, eſpecially when they take with it, and be moan it, in that they have been <hi>as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> Iſai. 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on in the way of his heart;</hi> and what follows? <hi>I have ſeen his way, and will heal him, and will reſtore comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and to his mourners.</hi> I am God, and not man, I am a merciful God, I'le miſken my petted people, and heal them, I'le not proſecute this quarrel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The riches and fulneſs of his mercy appears in his fetching an Argument from his ſtroaks, to pity his people; a ſtroak extorted out of his hand, to pity his people; a ſtroak inflicted in juſtice, mercy will make it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pity the afflicted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? Is he a pleaſant child? For ſince I spake against him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill;</hi> my chiding and contending with him hath wakened my bowels towards him, <hi>I will ſurely have mercy on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The fulneſs and riches of this mercy appears in this, that he conſiders tenderly the conſequences of his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he quarrel with them, mercy tells him, he may ſoon get the victory, but that will loſe him his people, therefore he will forbear, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, nor will I be always wroth.</hi> Why? <hi>The ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls that I have made:</hi> I could ſoon deſtroy them, but that I may not do, and therefore will not contend for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 6. The riches and fulneſs of his mercy may be read in this, that when he lets out bowels of mercy, there will be no mercy which the Creature needs, will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from them. When <hi>Iſhmael</hi> hath ſlain <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> whom
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:47356:230"/>
the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had made the <hi>Jews</hi> Governour, and they are afraid of the <hi>Chaldeans; Be not afraid of the King of Babylon,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for I am with you, to ſave and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, and I will ſhew mercy to you, that he may have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on you,</hi> Jer. 42.11, 12. Fear not, if ye partake of my mercy, I will make the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> compaſſionat you: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106 44. <hi>He regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry, and he remembred his Covenant, and repented ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of his mercies.</hi> What follows? <hi>he made them alſo to be pitied of all that carried them captives.</hi> He needs no other inſtruments of compaſſion to his people, nor bitter enemies, when he will have compaſſion on them. So <hi>Solomon</hi> prays, <hi>Give them compaſſion before them that carry them captive,</hi> 1 King. 8.50. And <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> when he is to keep the Paſſover, tells the people, <hi>If they turn again to the Lord, their brethren and children ſhall find compaſſion before them that lead them captive,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.9. Gods compaſſion can ſoon bring the compaſſion of men, in ſo far as he ſees it needful. Thus ye ſee in a few hints, how rich and full the mercy of God is. In a word, it's a mercy for all the needs and preſſures of his people, a Plaiſter broad enough to cover, and effectual enough to cure all their griefs and ſores.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of this great truth, <hi>That with the Lord there is mercy,</hi> I ſhall briefly touch on five inferences from it, and leave it.</p>
            <p>And 1. If this mercy of God be relative to mans miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if it be good news manifeſted to the Creature, on the account of its miſery, then thoſe who are partakers of this mercy, would have much ſenſe of their miſery; mercy will not reliſh to any, but to the man ſenſible of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; a pardon will ſignify nothing, but to a Rebel that is ſenſible of his Rebellion: And here all that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the riches, freeneſs, fulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this mercy; if ye read it right, will be the firſt Leſſon ye will learn
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:47356:230"/>
from it; all this is not proclaimed for a complement, but becauſe it's needed by the miſerable: And conſequently thou muſt infer, If I have a right to you mercy, it muſt not be ordinary thoughts of my miſery that I muſt have there muſt be deeps of miſery in me, to call for deeps of mercy in God. If we thus fence the point, we need not fear that it be a ſleeping Pillow to the ſecure; look what miſery is in thee to cloſe with every thing in mercy. If mercy be free, look what ill-deſerving is in thee; if pardoning-mercy be in God, look what ſenſe of unpardoned guilt is in thee; if multitudes of mercies be in God, what ſenſe of multitude of miſeries is in thee? They that have a right to mercy, muſt tryſt it in the duſt, in the very pit of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this, that there is mercy with God, there is ground of aſſurance offered and afforded to the miſerable, that their irrecoverable caſe by the Covenant of Works is not now deſperat. O! the bleſſed intimation of that Attribute to fallen man, that with God there is mercy; How good news was it, and ſhould it be? What had been the caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity, after the Covenant of Works was broken, had it not been for this bleſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that interpoſed? But now, becauſe there is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God, irrecoverable diſtreſſes are not deſperate: Somewhat ye heard of this from <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, and 4. What a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable caſe had all been in, if there had been no more to be lookt for, but that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>If thou, Lord, mark iniquities, O Lord, who ſhould ſtand?</hi> But a gracious anſwer is added, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>But there is forgivenneſs</hi> or mercy <hi>with thee;</hi> and how this is preſt upon the account of Gods mercy, ye have an account given, <hi>Jer.</hi> 55.67. <hi>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call on him while he is near; let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord:</hi> Why? <hi>For he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> That there
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:47356:231"/>
is mercy in God abundantly to pardon, is an intimation to the man that is in an irrecoverable condition, to look again to God; And in that 2d of <hi>Joel,</hi> after that the Lord hath uttered a ſore and terrible Judgment, and hath told <hi>verſe</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. That he will utter his voice before his Army, for his Camp is very great, and ſtrong is he that executes his word; (and in the by, if the Lord hath a Nation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, he needs not raiſe, and bring in an uncouth Nation to puniſh them, he can cauſe Graſhoppers or Locuſts do his turn) after all that, Verſe 12, 13. <hi>He bids them turn to him with all their heart, with faſting, weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil:</hi> When the Lord is ſetting forth, and inflicting an apparent and remedileſs ſtroak, this yet invites to repentance, <hi>That he is gracious and merciful,</hi> and therefore as on the one hand, thou that ſlights this offered mercy, and makes it a pillow to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, who when thou hears tell there is mercy with God, makes no uſe of it, but rather abuſes it, to go on in ſin; O the Juſtice of God in the day of thy accompts, will be a ſad ſight in compariſon of mercy; or, juſtice execute on ſlighters of mercy, will be dreadful Juſtice, then it will be, <hi>Hills and mountains fall on us, and bide us from the face of the Lamb,</hi> What, There is little ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in a Lambs Face; yea, but the fight of the Lambs face in the day of compt and reckoning, that he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered mercy was a Lamb, that mercy was with him will be moſt dreadful; think on it, ſlighters of the Goſpel, ſit-faſts, never-do-wells, abuſers of mercy, or ye that would take mercy in the accompliſhment, but never give mercy employment, who follow your abominations, if not openly, yet ſecretly; better for you that ye had ſitten all your time at the foot of <hi>Sinai,</hi> than at the foot of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>Zion.</hi> This is often told you, but little laid to heart, and the ofter it be told many, the leſs it is laid to heart; but the day will come, when many will get Hell affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:47356:231"/>
memories, wherein ye will remember, that which drops at your feet, and is not noticed, or is ſtept over, and not regarded: So on the other hand, thou who on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of hopeleſneſs in thy condition, runs away from God, take heed what thou doſt, thou looks on thy caſe as incurable, and what will thou do with it? If thou run away, where will thou go next? Thy caſe muſt either break thee, or thou will grow ſtupid under it: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if thou run away, thou reproaches the mercy of God, ſo far as thou can, while thou runs from him with any condition, how deſperat and irrecoverable ſo ever: and will thou bring up an ill report on his mercy, as if there were no cure in it for thy caſe? When thou ſhould rather ſing, as <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 13.5. In oppoſition to every hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs like caſe, <hi>But I have truſted in thy mercy, my heart ſhall rejoyce in thy ſalvation;</hi> O then take heed that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not, nor bring not up an ill report on this rich &amp; full mercy in God, by running from it, whatever thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be.</p>

Ye have heard of <hi>Jobs</hi> patience, and have ſeen the end of the Lord; and what was the end of the Lord, even this, That the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; O but they are ſad difficulties, which tender mercy and pity in God will not afford relief unto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think not your ſelf in a poor plight, who have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for your refuge, who have no ſong to ſing, <hi>But I have truſted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

My ſoul loathed them, and their ſoul alſo abhorred me; but when thou grips to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſee what influence it hath on thy heart for warming it, for putting it in a ſweet and tender frame on thy part;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47356:232"/>
may I ſay it, I defie folk to abuſe mercy, taken by the right handle; O the alluring, melting, conſtraining, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading power that is in mercy rightly cloſed with; and O that folk could win to this gate of making uſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. The Apoſtle in preſſing holineſs, ſaith, <hi>I beſeech you, brethren, by the mercy of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c.

Thou talks of mercy, yet thou art not overcome with it, thou art not melted, nor made more tender by it; what a cheater of thy ſelf, and abuſer of mercy art thou? Remember the abuſe of outward mercies, will make a ſad dittay; <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. <hi>If after all theſe we break his commands.</hi> But ah! what ſhall be ſaid when folk pretend to ſpecial mercy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it?</p>
            <p>But 5.

That it is the merciful that obtain mercy: And that Parable of the man that had much forgiven him, and would not forgive his fellow ſervant, but caſt him in priſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.23. — It was a ſad evidence that he was not pardoned himſelf. In a word, thou who art much in mercies common, it will make thee of a merciful &amp; meek temper, which is that preſſed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. <hi>That we ſhould ſpeak evil of no man, be no brawlers,</hi> &amp;c. but gentle, ſhewing meekneſs to all men, ſeeing we our ſelves were ſometime diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts: — But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared, not by works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Songs of the people of God, while they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time, are made up of very mixed Notes; yet in this they are ſweet, that their over-word, or laſt word is ſtill the beſt of it, Poor and needy are they, and may they be, yet they are thought upon by God; Troubled they may be, but not diſtreſt; perplext, but not in deſpair; perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. Much may they have to ſay, both from within them, and about them, to brangle their threed of hope, which is their great ſtock and ſtore-houſe; but they have infinitly more above them to ſupport it; though Iſrael be in miſery and bondage, and under ſervitude through ſin; yet ſays the Text, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in God;</hi> Let nothing they find within, or about them in the world brangle their confidence, <hi>For with the Lord there is mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye may remember, that from theſe encouragements to Iſrael <hi>to hope in God,</hi> I have been marking what is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the part of hopers, that they need mercy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and particularly redemption from iniquity; and <hi>I</hi> began to ſpeak the laſt day to what is propoſed for their encouragement, notwithſtanding all theſe diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they are under, and I took ſome time to ſpeak to that ſweet Attribute of Mercy in God. In ſpeaking to which ye had ſome account in general of the nature of this
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:47356:233"/>
mercy, and of the Object and Properties of it; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what was ſpoken to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the whole Doctrine; A Doctrine, which though ſome may abuſe, and break their neck on, and which will be the ſad dittay of theſe within the viſible Church, That mercy was in their offer, and they ſlighted it; yet it is a Doctrine abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to them that are lying under the ſenſe of ſin and miſery.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed to a 2d. main Point, to encourage Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to hope in God, <hi>That with him is plenteous redemption,</hi> That is, both Authority to redeem, and power to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat his people out of the bondage and ſervitude, wherein they are, and that in a great meaſure, a plenteous redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and that is connected with the former, with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That ſame God with whom there is mercy, hath alſo plenteous redemption, which gives a ground to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Remark, that I ſhall batter out a little, that mercy in God, is not a bare naked affection (if I may ſo word it) in him, as ye may find it amongſt creatures, ſome are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merciful and compaſſionat, and can condole the caſe of others in chains, when they cannot help them, they may weep over them, whom they cannot relieve: But I ſay, mercy is not ſuch a bare naked affection in God, but it is accompanied with authority and power, to make the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his mercy forthcoming for the miſerable, as he finds there is cauſe.</p>
            <p>To lay this a little open to you; and in the paſſing thorow, to hint at ſome <hi>Uſes</hi> of it, I ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe three; 1. What this redemption imports. 2. Why it is called redemption. And 3. What the plenty of this redemption that is with God, may look to, or hint at.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, What redemption imports, ye know that redemption properly is a recovery, by paying of a price, or by exchange or otherwiſe, of that which hath been brought in bondage, or under the power of another. Now
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47356:234"/>
redemption when it is attribute to God, imports a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his people out of that bondage of ſin and miſery, unto which through their own folly, they have caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And for the import of it, beſide mercy relative to their miſery, who have ſold themſelves; it imports both authority to redeem, and power to redeem. 1. Authority, and authority of Soveraignity in Dominion, to recover, or bring back, what, or whom he pleaſes, out of that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſervitude, under which they had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To allude to that Plea of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> anent the Redemption of Captives, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.24. Shall the lawful Captive be delivered, we have taken them lawful Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and who has authority to interpoſe and take them from us? So when guilt, and juſtice purſuing for guilt, hath the Iſrael of God, lawful Captives, in that caſe he hath authority, and ſupremacy, a ſoveraign dominion to interpoſe for the Redemption of his people, when he will, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.8. Salvation belongs to the Lord; it is his prerogative royal to give ſalvation, to redeem, as Princes have a power Paramount to pardon Crimes the Law ſtrikes againſt; he hath a power to pardon, to love freely, to ſee his peoples ways, and to heal them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.18. That is the firſt thing then imported in this redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an authority and right to redeem; and before I paſſe from it. I would leave this word with the people of God, that when their diſtreſſes are great and many, and all other doors are ſhut on them, they would learn to look to Soveraignty in God, as the Latin Proverb is, They may be in that caſe wherein ſalvation cannot ſave them, and then they muſt look no laigher than God, and to a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Dominion in God to redeem, remembring what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the ſad premiſſes in their caſe, he hath a dominion to make the concluſion what he pleaſeth, his authority and ſoveraign dominion can make the concluſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, when the premiſſes writes bitter things againſt them; this would be the laſt anchor that we would hold
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:47356:234"/>
by, when all others are driven and come home; and I would have you ſo far from miſtaking and ſtumbling, when ye look to Soveraignty in God, and ye are brought ſo low, that you have no claim, but to put off your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and ſee what God will do to you; all things in your caſe, or what ye can look to for relief, are ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deſperat, only ye dare not limit God, I would in this caſe have you ſo far from ſtumbling at Soveraignty in God, that I would have you rather afraid, when ye have any thing to look to beneath it. It is ſad when God is afflicting his people with croſſe Providences, it ſhould be with them, as with that people. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.37. They go forth from him with their hands on their head, and the Lord hath rejected their confidence, that is a ſad trade when Gods work of Providence is, to blaſt and reject their carnal confidence, and to defeat them, that they ſhall not proſper in them, becauſe they will not quite them, and lay their deplorable caſe at the footſtool of Soveraignty in God; So much for the firſt thing imported in redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That is, authority to redeem.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Redemption in God imports further, even a power to exerciſe that authority and dominion, for the actual redemption of his people, many a time experience ſhows that authority is baffled and affronted in the world, becauſe it is not in its way backed with power; but our bleſſed Lord, who has authority to redeem, has alſo power to exerciſe that authority, and actually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, he is the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, to whom nothing is too hard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>Our God is in heaven, he hath done whatever he pleaſed. Pſal.</hi> 135.6. <hi>Whatever the Lord pleaſed, that he did in heaven and in the earth,</hi> &amp;c. And ye have his power aſſerted in this very affair, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.24. <hi>Shal</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the prey be taken from the mighty, or the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful captive be delivered?</hi> We hear tell (would they ſay) of the redemption of Iſrael from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity; but we plead, that they are not only lawful captives, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:47356:235"/>
in war, but we are mighty to detain them; yea, <hi>but</hi> (ſays the Lord) <hi>even the captives of the mighty ſhall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered,</hi> were ye never ſo mighty and terrible, when I interpoſe, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, and recover the prey. I ſhall not need to inſiſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the confirmation of this.</p>
            <p>But 1. Any of you who are afflicted and ſenſible of your ſtraits, and of the ſins that have drawn them on; will ye believe this, that there is not only mercy with God, but power to manifeſt that mercy, and it may content you to ly in the Hoſpital of his heart, till he ſee it fit to manifeſt his power for your redemption. If there be with him not only mercy, but redemption, it muſt certainly ſay ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, than ordinarly we apprehend, that he wants neither power nor good will to redeem his people, for with their God there is mercy, and with him, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were their hazard as peremptor, as that of the three children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. Who were to be caſt in the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, this is ſupport enough, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is able to deliver us,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore when we are in ſtraits, and reckon that we want proofs of his power, we would reckon alſo, that it is not for want of good will, for with him is mercy, and it ſhould content and quiet our hearts, to take lodging in his compaſſion, till he let the world ſee, that with him alſo is plenteous redemption in the effects of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this I would recommend to you, to ſtudy to believe this power much; it is not for nothing that it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21. <hi>That he staggered not at the promiſe through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God;</hi> Why? He was fully perſwaded, that what he promiſed, he was alſo able to perform; and the three children did not ſpeak ordinary news, when they tell <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, The God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace;</hi> It is true, generally people think they doubt not of the power of God, all their doubting
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:47356:235"/>
is, about his goodwill, as that man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean;</hi> but they that know themſelves beſt, will ſee atheiſm at the bottom of their diffidence, and a doubting of his power as well as of his goodwill; therefore this is an evidence, that folks win eaſily to Faith in ſmaller and petty Tryals, wherein there is not much need of power, then their Faith will ſoar aloft: but in great Tryals they ſuccumb and ſink, and find their Faith a ſeeking; and whence flows this, but from unbelief, <hi>That with God there is power to redeem:</hi> and therefore I beſeech the people of God to ſtudy to believe, and be fixed in the faith of the Attributes of God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the faith of his power in difficulties.</p>
            <p>But 3. From this I ſay, I would have the people of God not to ſtumble, though in their ſtraits they be left on the Power and Omnipotency of God alone, to relieve them; <hi>Let Iſrael hope,</hi> Why? Not becauſe they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat themſelves out of difficulties, not becauſe ordinary help will do their turn, but becauſe <hi>with God is redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and plenteous redemption;</hi> becauſe God is Omnipotent to vindicat them out of their bondage; it is kindly to have ſaints brought frequently to be in Gods miſter, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God can do their turn; ſo that they think they have done with it, if God interpoſe not, when they are brought to ſuch perplexing queſtions, as that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>Can theſe dry bones live?</hi> That only Omnipotent Power in God can anſwer; then they would not ſtumble when they are brought that low, that their Faith is left upon the Omnipotency of God alone; that power of God, if (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did) thou take it up rightly; If thou believe on him who quickens the dead, and calls on things that are not, as if they were, becauſe he makes them to be: It is enough to anſwer all thy difficult queſtions; Therefore (whatever thy difficulties be) guard againſt ſtumbling from this, <hi>That with God is redemption, and plenteous redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> So much from what is imported in this redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:47356:236"/>I proceed in the 2d place to give you ſome account, why this is called redemption; and if we reſtrict redemption here to Iſrael (and it is theſe who are bidden hope on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Redemption, and it is Iſrael, that (<hi>verſe</hi> 8.) <hi>He will redeem from all their iniquities</hi>) The deliveries of the Lords people are fitly and frequently expreſt, under the name of Redemption, not only their deliverance from ſin, as <hi>verſe</hi> 8. but deliverance from trouble, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Redeem Iſrael, O God, out of all his troubles.</hi> Now, I ſay, That moſt fitly and frequently, the deliveries of Gods people are called a Redemption on a threefold account, which I ſhall firſt propone, and then ſpeak to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As they have a relation to their ſpiritual Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt. 2. As they have a relation to the troublers of Iſrael, his people, from whoſe power they are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 3. As they have relation to the iſſue of their troubles; That it is a redemption, and ſetting them at freedom from ſervitude and bonds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, The deliverances of the people of God are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Redemption, all of them, becauſe they are founded on, and are the reſult of their eternal and ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, through Chriſt, all their deliverances are the appendices, and (as ye call it) the bounty ſuper added to that great Redemption, which they have by the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt; and upon this account it is, that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to the people of God are noticed, as evidences of his love to them in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.19. <hi>He delivered me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, becauſe he delighted in me.</hi> It was a proof of reconciled love to him in Chriſt, That God delivered him from his troubles; and hence all that the Lords people get, and their deliveries among the reſt, are gifts beſtowed on them with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things;</hi> Unto the Iſrael of God, Chriſt is firſt freely given, and then with him, in him, and through him,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:47356:236"/>
all other things, and their deliveries among the reſt, are afforded them on that account.</p>
            <p>This I mark on a threefold account. 1. To preſs u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon folk the exerciſe of piety, and the making ſure of an intereſt in Chriſt, and his Redemption; for that's your ground and claim to all other mercies. When Chriſt is diverting his Diſciples from careful anxiety, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. He bids them <hi>ſeek the Kingdom of God firſt, and all other things ſhall be added to them.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe profiteth little, but godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Many never mind this, that godlineſs, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſure an intereſt in Chriſt, is the only thriving gate: as for ſuch as find proſperity in another method, I ſhall ſpeak to them juſt now. But for you that are godly, or pretend to godlineſs, to be taken up in ſeeking things in time, ye forget your main work; when ye are too eager and keen in your purſuit of theſe things, wherein if God love you, he will not let you thrive: I wot not what of this is among you, but if there be a nearneſs, a nipped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eagerneſs after the things of the world, in that you may read your poverty; if ye be ſeeking God, and making an Idol of the world, or any things in it, he loves you better than to let you proſper in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; and if ye would thrive indeed, put godlineſs in the firſt place, begin at it as the work of all your thrift.</p>
            <p>But 2. Becauſe many may laugh at this Exhortation, founded on this, that other mercies come as the reſult of Redemption through Chriſt, and therefore that folk ought in the firſt place to ſicker an intereſt in him; and think that they ſpeed beſt in things of time, that neglect Piety, I might bid them laugh at leaſure. Many profane folks, that have had more proſperity than heart could wiſh, and have thought they ſhould never be in adverſity, and that they had no need of God to hold to their head; they have win
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:47356:237"/>
through it all, and have been put to imbrace dunghills, and in their ſtraitned condition have been contemptible, when the godly have ſhined in their greateſt poverty. But that which I preſs here, is, that every lot that folk have, they would ſee how they hold it, by what Title and Right, thou that gets the mercy of proſperity, or a delivery out of trouble, if thou be not intereſted in Chriſt, and a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of holineſs, it's but as a Bone caſt at a Dog for thy portion, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4. And I ſhall tell you the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of ſuch men, from that parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Son,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich glutton) <hi>remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> Thou haſt proſperity while thou neglects piety, but it may be thou art getting what thou gets in wrath; and while thou art running to Satan and perdition, thou gets out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies as a Poſt-horſe, to further thee in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Journey; yea, thou who art a child of God, may be getting outward mercies, when God is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thee. There is a ſad word 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. after the Apoſtle has ſpoken of great mercies conferred on Gods people, he ſubjoyns, <hi>But with many of them God was not well pleaſed, for they were overthrown in the wilderneſs:</hi> And therefore thou that would put a right value on mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, read them at that rate, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.16. where when he hath ſpoken of <hi>bringing the blind by the way they knew not, making darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtraight,</hi> he ſubjoyns, <hi>Theſe things will I do unto them, and not forſake them;</hi> look if thou has God with what thou haſt. Have a man what he will, till he have intereſt in him, and ſtand in his favour, he has little cauſe to inſult or boaſt. If thy mercies be not the reſult of redemption through Chriſt, they will turn a ſnare.</p>
            <p>But a 3d word of Inference from this, is, that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to the fearers of God, who have an intereſt in his
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:47356:237"/>
love, and are ſtudying to walk tenderly, to look ſweetly on their portion and lot in time, what-ever it be; it may be thy ſhare in the things in time is little, thy troubles many, thy breathing times betwixt troubles ſhort, thy comfort mixt with what is bitter and ſad; but that which will make all reliſh, is, that the ſame love that has given Chriſt for thee, and to thee, and will give thee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting happineſs, hath afforded theſe mercies as the reſult and appendices of that great redemption, and that ſame love will ſanctify all thy croſſes, and make them work for thy good: And O! How ſweet might ſorry accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, mean food and raiment be, to have this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over them, That love that hath given Chriſt for me, and to me, and will give me a Crown one day, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me theſe? This might be rich and ſweet Sauce to a ſober Diet, excellent Furniture to a poor Houſe, to learn to look on theſe as the reſult of the great Bargain. Seek to have your intereſt in Chriſt, your Union and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him more near and warm, and to be more tender: That thus ye may look on your mercies and be comforted; the Lord bleſs what ye have heard.</p>

            <p>MAny are the exceptions and grounds of fears which the people of God entertain, for foſtering their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and no fewer are the Cordials that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in God to make out that to them, that when they are afraid, they are called to truſt in God; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is invited to hope in God, if miſery and ill-deſerving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard their obedience to that command, they are told here, that <hi>with the Lord there is mercy.</hi> If they look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as lawful Captives, and none have a right to offer
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:47356:238"/>
to reſcue or ranſome them, they are told here, that <hi>with the Lord there is redemption,</hi> a Soveraign Authority, Right and Power, to ſtep in when he will, and vindicate them into freedom: If they look upon it as hard and impoſſible ever to get out of the bonds they are under, <hi>with him is plenteous redemption,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.7. <hi>To looſe the Priſoners, and open the priſon doors, and ſet them at liberty.</hi> This is that I was ſpeaking to in the morning, That <hi>with God there is redemption.</hi> I cleared, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption imported Authority and Right to redeem, and power to reedeem and vindicate: And I came in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place to clear in what reſpects this Redemption is ſo called, or in what reſpects his delivery of his people is called, a Redemption of them. And the firſt to which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it's becauſe all their deliverances are founded upon, and are the reſult of their eternal Redemption through Chriſt; the Uſes whereof I mentioned, and ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
            <p>I proceed now in the 2d place, to clear that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is ſo called, or their delivery is called Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in relation to their trouble, and the inſtruments of their trouble, from whom God will redeem them; not by paying a price for them, for that is already payed to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for doing away the controverſie that God the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Creditor had with them, who therefore put them in Bonds, and under Arreſt; but by the ſtrong hand he redeems them from the inſtruments of their trouble, to their own coſt, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.3. The Lord tells his people, <hi>that they had ſold themſelves for nought,</hi> they had made a poor Bargain, or they had provocked God to ſell them into their enemies hands for nought, but they ſhould be redeemed as cheap, <hi>without money,</hi> Iſai. 43.14. The Lord proves himſelf to be the Redeemer of his people by this, that for their ſakes he had ſent to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to get them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:47356:238"/>
hence, and had brought down all their Nobles, and the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> whoſe cry is in the Ships, or to the Ships, to ſeek Veſſels to run away, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> came and turned in the River on the City. And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.24, 25, 26. when they accounted the people of God their prey, and lawful captives, the Lord not only tells them, that <hi>the captives of the mighty ſhall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered,</hi> but he will pay a ranſome to the <hi>Caldeans</hi> for them, and what is that? <hi>I will feed them that oppreſs thee with their own fleſh, and they ſhall be drunk with their own blood, as with ſweet wine:</hi> That ſhall be the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome that he will give the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> when he delivereth his people. I ſhall not dwell on this; in general it holds out this, that they are in a ſad and ill taking, who are left by themſelves to take Gods people to taſk; they are as theſe who would go betwixt a Man and his Wife, who when the friendſhip is made up, will get little thanks, and therefore they are rather to be pitied than envyed. It bods little good to men, when God makes uſe of them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the afflictions of his people; and any that ye would wiſh good unto, pray that they may be preſerved from that Pit, and any ye ſee ingaged in it, ye cannot do them a better turn, than to ſtand in the Gapp for them, and pray they may be delivered out of it, for it is fatal and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to be inſtruments of the people of Gods trouble, and to be found ſtanding in his way when he is to redeem them.</p>
            <p>But in the 3d place, I told you, that their Delivery is called Redemption, in relation to the iſſue of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery from their troubles, as the Captive or Priſoner, when he is redeemed, or the ranſom payed, is ſet free, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and ſet at liberty to go where he will: So God's delivering of a people, brings freedom and enlargement, a breaking of Bonds, an opening of Priſon doors, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of them from bondage and ſlavery. Hence the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:47356:239"/>
of the ſaints is metaphorically expreſſed, by ſetting of them at large, or in a large place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.19. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was hampered before, when he was in trouble, but he got enlargement and ſkiproom by God's deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.8. <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Thou haſt not ſhut me up into the hand of the Enemy, thou haſt ſet my feet in a large place,</hi> or room; had <hi>I</hi> been amongſt my enemies, they had hemm'd me in; but God in delivering me, gives me elbow-room; and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.5. <hi>I called on the Lord in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, the Lord anſwered me, and ſet me in a large place;</hi> or anſwered me in a large place: (for theſe words, <hi>and ſet me,</hi> are a ſupplement in the Text, that is, with enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by enlargement and freedom he delivered me; So <hi>Job</hi> 36.16. Where <hi>Elihu</hi> is giving <hi>Job</hi> an account what he might have expected, had he improved God's corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions aright. Even ſo (ſaith he) would he have removed thee out of the ſtrait into a broad place, where there is no ſtraitneſs; <hi>Thou art</hi> (would he ſay, as <hi>verſe</hi> 8.) <hi>bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction;</hi> but had thou heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the inſtructions communicat to thee by the Rod, God ſhould have brought thee out of that ſtrait into a broad place, where there is no ſtraitneſs; ſo that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the iſſue, delivery is enlargement, a giving of ſkup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room to them that were in bonds and preſſures before.</p>
            <p>And from this I would have you reflecting on two or three words, 1. It imports, that when the people of God are in trouble, unredeemed, they ſhould be in ſtraits, and as under preſſures, ſenſible of their affliction, their bonds ſhould preſs them; Therefore in that fore-cited place, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8. Affliction is called bonds, or fetters and cords, and <hi>Job,</hi> when he is viewing God's dealing with him, ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.27. Thou putteſt my feet alſo in the ſtocks; not only did he put him in priſon, for a man in priſon, has room to walk up and down, but in priſon he put his feet in the ſtocks; importing that folks ſhould find a preſſure when God afflicts them, they ſhould be ſtraitned when
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:47356:239"/>
they are in the ſtocks; ſtupidity is ill company, when God is uſing means means to waken out of ſecurity, and to make folk ſenſible, and to be taking too much elbow room, when folks are under an arreſt of Providence, it is no good evidence, that he will give enlargement, <hi>Job</hi> 35.15. Hypocrites in heart heap up wrath, they cry not when he binds them; when folks are ſtraitned, they would feel it, and eſpecially they ſhould find their ſtraitning, that they may cry to God when he binds them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.12. <hi>He brought down their hearts with labour;</hi> he brake their ſpirits with toil, he hammered their undaunted hearts with ſit-faſt and ſore preſſures, and further he dealt ſo with them till they fell down, and there was none to help, and then <hi>they cryed to the Lord in their trouble, and he ſaved them,</hi> &amp;c. That is the great deſign of preſſures, when folks are ſo hampered, that they cannot ſtir their feet, when they are ſo ſtraitned that they wot not what hand to turn them to, it is, That they may cry to God, and he may ſave them.</p>
            <p>Hence, 2. Many ſad lamentations may the viſible Church, and even ſaints write over their own frames un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſſures, that they are ſo little affected; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that be they preſſed never ſo much, there is little prayer under their preſſures, as in that forecited place, <hi>Job</hi> 36.13. When <hi>Elihu</hi> is telling what ſhould be folks car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when they are bound with fetters, and holden in cords of affliction, he tells the Hypocrites in heart, heap up wrath, they cry not when God binds them; few folks preſſures are ſeen in their prayers, either in doubling their diligence in their duty, or in their manner of going about it, they have few prayers, that look like diſtreſt folks pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; O let fruitleſs improvers of preſſures, ponder at large <hi>Job</hi> 36.8. to 18. Where when <hi>Elihu</hi> has told the benefit of well improved preſſures, and the hazard of ill improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſſures, he tells <hi>Job verſe</hi> 16. Even ſo would he have removed thee out of the ſtrait into a broad place; But <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Thou has fulfilled the judgement of the wicked, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:47356:240"/>
and judgement take hold on thee;</hi> Therefore becauſe there is wrath, beware leſt he take thee away with his ſtroak, then a great ranſom cannot deliver thee; evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved preſſures, will occaſion ſad reflections, and may bring on ſtroaks, from which folks will not eaſily come to be delivered; O how oft may we write that over ill improved preſſures, which ye have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13. <hi>O that my people had hearkened to me, and Iſrael had walked in my ways,</hi> I <hi>would ſoon have ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries.</hi> And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.18. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened to my commandment, then had thy peace been as a river,</hi> &amp;c. It muſt be otherwayes with preſſed ſaints, than it is with others. It is a ſin and a ſhame that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ruines are under ſaints hands, not improved, but a double ſin &amp; ſhame, that they ſhould increaſe under their hand, and an evidence they have not been improved.</p>
            <p>But a 3d word moſt directly from what <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken on this branch, is this, That if every delivery be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and enlargement, Then it calls the people of God to be comforted and enlarged, under every mercy and proof of love, how mean ſoever it be. The Lord who calls men in the day of adverſity to conſider, calls them in the day of proſperity to be comforted, and joyful in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meaſure of redemption that they meet with, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.14. And it's marked by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and others, when God had brought Iſrael into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and gave them abundance of good things, they delighted themſelves in his great goodneſs, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.25. a practice very rare among God's people, proofs of love, particular redemption triſts them, which calls them to rejoyce in God and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet they are where they were when they got them, their mercies are little ſeen upon them, by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements given them; and what wonder therefore that mercies be withholden from them, who cannot be worſe with the want of them, than when they have them, they droop when they have, and they droop when they want:
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:47356:240"/>
the having of them is no enlargement to them, and this they mourn not for as a ſin, they are better at picking quarrels at them, than at being thankful for them, which ſpeaks a proud unſubdued ſelfie diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> ſhall not ſtand to diſcuſs the ſhifts and pretexts, that folks make uſe of in their byaſſes, in ſetting no value on Redemptions beſtowed on them, many a time their own ſpirit is a ſpirit of bondage, when God allows on them a ſpirit of liberty. It is not the want of allowances from God, but the want of enlargement of heart, a ſlaviſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſpoſition, that makes a ſpirit of bondage, when it is not Gods allowance. Sometime they pretend the ſmalneſs of the mercy, to undervalue it, when they rather proclaim the want of humility in themſelves. The humbled Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. Under many preſſures ſees, <hi>That it is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed;</hi> if our mercies be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with our luſtings, or deſervings, they will be great and admirable mercies. And ſometimes the cloud of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued preſſures hides the ſight of partial Redemptions; but certainly, every evidence of mercy remembred in wrath, is a redemption, and ſhould be delighted in, and our heart ſhould be enlarged in receiving it as ſuch, in a word, it is an evidence of a bleſt diſpoſition, when what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be folks lots, they love not to caſt out with God, they love not to fiſh faults with his Providence, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a mean mercy, how inſignificant ſoever it be to their ſenſe; and when they are content to pick up their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies amongſt the crouds of their croſſes, that theſe ſhall not tempt them, not to be comforted in the meaneſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and who knows but ſuch a frame, if it were ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might prove a door of hope to the increaſe and growth of favours; they that delight to commend mercies, ſhall find them grow. Now <hi>I</hi> have done with the accounts on which deliveries are called Redemptions.</p>
            <p>In the third place it remains, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſpeak a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the plentifulneſs of theſe redemptions; <hi>With him there
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:47356:241"/>
is plenteous redemption.</hi> Ye heard the laſt day when I was ſpeaking of the mercy of God, That God is <hi>full of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and plenteous in mercy, Pſal.</hi> 86.5, 15. That he has manifold mercies. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.19. and that he is abundant in goodneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. Here <hi>He is plenteous in redemption,</hi> and this hath relation to theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the variety of the preſſures, the ſaints may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with, for plenteous redemption ſpeaks plentiful preſſures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the recurring of theſe preſſures, that when folk are brought out of them, they fall in them again through their own folly; <hi>There is plenteous redemption with God</hi> in relation to both.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, The variety of preſſures wherewith ſaints may be aſſaulted, There is ſomewhat, 1. Suppoſed here, That not only the Iſrael of God may have preſſures, but a variety, a great many of them; Hence <hi>Eliphaz, Job</hi> 5.19. Suppoſing <hi>Job</hi> a penitent, ſays, God ſhould deliver him in ſix troubles and in ſeven, a number of perfection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. The Apoſtle ſays, we are troubled on every ſide, and <hi>Ch.</hi> 6.7. He tells, There is need of the armour of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both on the right and left hand; there is no hand we can turn us to, would he ſay, but there is need of armour, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.5. Troubled on every ſide, without are fightings, and within were fears; and in a word, the Church tells us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.22. That God had called, as in a ſolemn day, her terrors round about her, in the day of Gods anger no preſſure was wanting, and there was a convention of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence from this, that variety of preſſures are the lot of the people of God, it doth on the one hand point out, that they are ill to tame, ill to hold, like a wild aſs, ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing up the wind; it is not eaſie ſiſting them, except they be hedged in on all hands; hard wedges tells there are hard ſtone or timber to be divided; and they who have many preſſures, may ſit down and lament over their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:47356:241"/>
that leſs would not do their turn; many might ſteal more quietly in to heaven, were it not for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that are ſo wild and ill to be tamed; Though yet I ſhall add, the more preſſures thou haſt, if thou could improve them well, thou has the more doors open for mercy, and occaſions to get meat out of the eater.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From it I would have many folks learning to ſilence their murmuring and complaining, many have learned a gad of crying ere they be toucht; there be many, who though there be preſſures be ſuch, as many of the people of God would count an outgate, yet there is no biding of their complaining: O! what would many of you do if ye were put in <hi>Job's</hi> caſe, who in one day was ſtript of all that he had, and the next day of his health and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, and yet he was born through; it is a great evidence of mortification, to be enabled to bear preſſures well, to make little din of grievances; much din and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under them, tells there are many boyls to be let out, and many complaints call on God to lay more on folk to tame them better. O! be ſober, and if ye be put in a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> ſee if ye can build houſes there, and make your preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as ſupportable, as lawfully ye may without ſin, make them not intolerable, for that is to break your back, but ſee how tolerable ye can make them, without ſinning againſt God, that ye may dwell beſide your croſs, with ſilence and ſubmiſſion, who wots, but ere many days go over, ye may meet with an out-gate.</p>
            <p>But 2. As variety of preſſures are ſuppoſed here; ſo it expreſſes plenty of Redemption in God for all that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; time will not permit me to break in on that other thing, that this plenteous Redemption relates to, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring of preſſures, how frequently the people of God may fall under repeated preſſures, and may be ofter than once preſſed, but here for variety of preſſures, there is plenteous redemption, <hi>He will deliver in ſix troubles, and in ſeven, Job</hi> 5.19. If they be aſſaulted on the right and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:47356:242"/>
left hand, there is armour of righteouſneſs for both, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. If they be troubled on every ſide, he can keep them from being diſtreſſed if perplexed, they ſhall not deſpair, &amp;c 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. If they be troubled on every ſide, have fightings without, and fears within, God that comforts thoſe that are caſt down, can comfort them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.8. When thou ſits down, and cannot tell all thy preſſures, and are like a weak patient, who when his wounds are opened up, ſwerfs, thy heart grows ſick and thou faints. He is all ſufficient to afford Cordials for thy ſupport; thou cannot have ſo many wants, but he can ſupply them: And as the old man ſaid to the <hi>Levit, Judges</hi> 19.20 <hi>All thy wants ſhall be upon him;</hi> Thou cannot be ſtraitned in God, though through the narrowneſs of thy confidence, thou may be ſtraitned in thy own bowels, <hi>for with him is plenteous redemption;</hi> Think upon this, ye that have to do with it, ye that in your preſſures are left on God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, bring up a good report on him, cry not up your wants above his furniture; cry not up your griefs above his conſolations, which cannot be exhauſted; this would make folks life not ſo comfortleſs as oft times they make it to themſelves, while they cry out, What will they do with this, and with that, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Jer.</hi> 12 5. <hi>If thou haſt run with the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and they have wearied thee, then how can thou contend with horſes?</hi> If thy few preſſures have laid thee by, What wilt thou do with more and greater? If in the land of peace, wherein thou truſted, they have wearied thee, (I ſhall not ſay thou wilt have that atheiſtical word, What ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God do?) But what wilt thou do, if it come to the ſwellings of <hi>Jordan?</hi> But if thou keep thy eye and heart on that word, <hi>With God is plenteous redemption;</hi> and then ask, what ſhall I do with my troubles? I ſay, even bear them, go to God and get much from him to bear them; many proofs of his power and love, his all ſufficiency is
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:47356:242"/>
infinite to bear thee thorow; and bod well of him, and have well: look down on the greateſt number of preſſures as tolerable in his ſtrength. I love not carnal confidence, but God loves not drooping, or that folk ſhould go diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to their work, though humble they ſhould be. They that go drooping to their work, will come halting from it: but though a ſolemn aſſembly of terrors ſhould ſurround you, hold your eye o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AS there is no ſearching out of the Almighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as to what he is in himſelf, for he is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Heavens (as it is ſaid of his Wiſdom) and deeper than the Earth. So that what can we do or know? <hi>Job</hi> 11.7 8. So we are as little able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or fathom all that is in him, for the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and what wonder when over and above all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Promiſes, he hath given himſelf away to be their God, hath made infinitneſs their portion. Here we have a taſte of what riches are in him for the behove of his people; That for miſery in Iſrael, <hi>with the Lord there is mercy;</hi> that for bondage and ſlavery in Iſrael, <hi>with him is plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> And for the particular bondage and preſſure of ſin, <hi>He will redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities.</hi>

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:47356:243"/>
alſo that it was called redemption on a threefold account; 1. On the account of its riſe and fountain, that every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and delivery the people of God get, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and is the reſult of their great Redemption by Chriſt. 2. It is ſo called, with an eye to the trouble and troublers from which he redeems his Iſrael, but without money. 3. That it is ſo called, upon the account of the iſſue; when the Lord delivers his people, he ſets them at freedom and liberty, he ſets their feet in a large place, as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.19. I came alſo to ſpeak of the plenteouſneſs of this Redemption; The Text ſays, that not only there is redemption, but plenteous redemption with him; and (as I ſhewed) it is called plenteous redemption on a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account. 1. In relation to the great plenty and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preſſures, wherewith the people of God may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted on the right and on the left hand, with fightings without, and fears within; and as the Church hath it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.22. They may have their terrors called as in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day round about them; but in reference to all theſe, he hath plenteous redemption, to deliver from ſix troubles and from ſeven, to put on the armour of righteouſneſs when they are aſſaulted on the right hand and on the left, when they are troubled on every ſide, to keep them from being diſtreſſed; When perplexed, to keep them from deſpair, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. Of this I have ſpoken, and ſhall not repeat.</p>
            <p>It remains in the 2d place, That I ſpeak to this plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Redemption, as it relates to the frequent relapſes of the people of God into bondage through their folly, after the Lord hath brought them out of former preſſures, they betray themſelves, and bring themſelves under new preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they fall in new provocations, that bring them in new difficulties, which puts them again and again to look up to redemption in God. I ſhall follow out this a little in three heads.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:47356:243"/>1. It is not a thing unuſual to ſee the people of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been redeemed, to fall in relapſes, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new redemptions; for plenteous redemption in God needed not be proclaimed, if they were not obnoxious to frequent relapſes in bondage, and preſſures through their ſin, if they were not like that paſſionat man, or man of great wrath that ſuffers puniſhment; for if thou deliver him (ſays he) thou muſt do it again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.19. Let God pull them out of the mire, by his mighty and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand, they will be as ready to fall in it again, as if they had not been in it before; This is the complaint made of the Lords people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.43. Many a time did he deliver them, they got redemption often, but they provocked him with their counſel, and were brought low for iniquity. They were often well, but could not hold themſelves ſo. And if ye will conſider the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory deduced, <hi>Jud.</hi> 2.16. to 20. It is marked when they had provocked the Lord, to put them in bondage, that he raiſed up Judges, which delivered them out of the hand of theſe that ſpoiled them; but they would not hearken to their Judges, but went a whoring after other gods, and when for that they were brought in bondage, the Lord raiſed them up Judges, and was with the Judges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from enemies, but when the Judge was dead, they returned and corrupted themſelves. And <hi>Jud.</hi> 10.10, to 13. The Lord layes it home to them, when they came and complained to him by reaſon of the bondage they were under by the <hi>Ammonites, I delivered you</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>from the Egyptians, Amorites, the children of Ammon, and from the Philiſtines, the Sydonians alſo, and the Amalekites, and Maonites, when ye cryed to me, yet ye have forſaken me, and ſerved other gods;</hi> ye would not hold your ſelves well, when ye were well, therefore ye are now under the power of the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> I need not ſtand to tell you, how this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into bondage comes. Defection, declining, and departing from God, is the ſinful byaſs of our hearts, when
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:47356:244"/>
ever we are right, that motion is preternatural, or rather ſupernatural; we are naturally inclined to go a whoring from God; and not only ſo, but we are poſſeſt with a carnal confidence, that we ſhall do well, when we get our will, and God is provocked to blaſt that carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, by giving us a proof of what is in our hearts; and further the abuſe both of bondage, and delivery out of bondage; when folk can give a ſorry and poor account of what they have profited by the one, or by the other. It is no wonder that God be provocked to leave them in the mire, and to need Redemption a-new.</p>
            <p>Now all that I ſhall take from this ſhall be theſe two words. To guard all fleſh that they lean not the weight of their guiding on their outward condition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not of any lots they are under, as if they would do better, if freed of them; many when they are low, are ready to aſſoil themſelves, as to the neglect of duty, they are under this or that, which if they were freed of, they would do well, that is but a cheat. The Wall might go up in troubleſome times, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.25 When with the one hand they held the weapon, and built with the other; Mens tempers are ſuch, that give them their will in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conditions, they would not do better till God mend their Diſpoſitions, thou will ſay, thou art under want, and haſt no time to ſeek God; but had thou <hi>Creſus</hi>'s wealth, thou would not ſeek him better, if thy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were not helped. Thou has this or that faſhrie, and if that were taken off thee, thou would be more diligent, but conſiders not that if thou wanted that faſhry or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, thou would be more lazie, and if thou could guide the lot thou art under, it would quicken thee to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and help thee to diligence, and help thee to improve it to a ſpiritual advantage: In a word, blame not thy lot, of thy want of a diſpoſition, but thy diſpoſition, and then thou ſhall be in a capacity to go about duty, and get the good of thy lot whatever it be.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:47356:244"/>2. That as we would not complain of lots, ſo we would not truſt our fairds and reſolutions, to do right when God ſends redemption, when we are delivered, how doth the Novelty of it affect us, when God has broken the yoke and burſt the bonds; we ſay, we will not tranſgreſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>But he that truſts in his own heart is a fool, Prov.</hi> 28.26. For <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12, 13. When that people were on the edge of the red Sea, newly delivered, then they believed his word, and ſang his praiſes, but they ſoon forgat his works, they waited not for his counſel; they that have gotten a redemption wherewith they are affected, if they be not on their guard, they may put themſelves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wherein they may need a new proof of plenteous Redemption.</p>
            <p>But 2. As relapſes in bondage after we are redeemed, are too uſual in the people of God, ſo it is a hainous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible aggravation of their fault. It needs a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That with God is plenteous redemption</hi> to them that are ſenſible of it, it is no light matter (let folk think of it what they will) to ſell themſelves for nought. And when God hath redeemed them, to ſell themſelves over again; it was a terrible aggravation of <hi>Solomons</hi> fault, that he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Lord God of Iſrael, after that he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him twice, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.9. That after God had manifeſted himſelf to him, he ran away from him, and <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. Ye will ſee how that godly and reader man, looks on ſuch a practiſe as this; <hi>After all this is come upon us, for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſses ſeing thou our God has puniſht us leſs tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our iniquities deſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has given us ſuch deliverance as this, ſhould we again break by commandment, and joyn in affinity with the people of theſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, would thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping.</hi> He hath a dreadful apprehenſion of the deſert of relapſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Redemption, and no wonder they be ſo lookt upon, if we conſider partly, that the Lord delivers his people out
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:47356:245"/>
of trouble on theſe very terms, that they ſhould not turn again to folly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>The Lord will ſpeak peace to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſaints, but let them not turn again to folly;</hi> And, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. When a great objection is moved, <hi>How ſhall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleaſant land, a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heritage of the hoſt of nations?</hi> he anſwers thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt call me, my father, and ſhall not turn away from me.</hi> Now to fruſtrat Gods very end, and the terms on which he gives Redemption, muſt be a ſad aggravation of guilt: And further it is ſad, if we conſider, that God's giving parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Redemption to his people, is accompanied with engagements on our part, with our own conſent to do our duty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>When of old time I had broken thy yoke, and burſt thy bonds, thou ſaidſt, I will not tranſgreſs;</hi> thou took fair in hand, when on every high hill, and under every green tree, thou wandred, playing the harlot; thou ſaid, thou would give my kindneſs in delivering thee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meeting, when thou haſt foully deboarded: And further, it may be ſad, to look on thir relapſes, on the account of the folly that is in them; as in that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. When God ſpeaks peace to his people, if they turn to ſin, it is a folly; there is a folly and madneſs in that prank, for them who having ſinned, and God hath corrected them for ſin, and made them to find ſin an evil and bitter thing, to try again concluſions of that kind, and relapſe in theſe ſins, that hath bred them ſo much bitterneſs, who after they have met God in their teeth, hedging up their way with thorns, that they ſhould not find their loves, and God hath delivered them, yet no ſooner are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but they fall to that ſame way of ſinning, which brought them in bondage; what a folly and madneſs is in that?</p>
            <p>For Uſe, let me intreat you not to look lightly on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes, which have ſuch hainous aggravations, whether they be privat or publick relapſes, leſt God be provocked to make it apparent, that he looks not lightly on them,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:47356:245"/>
leſt (as it is <hi>Amos</hi> 7 7.) after the graſhoppers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending by fire, he come with a plum-line, and will not hearken to that pleading, <hi>Forgive, I beſeech thee; by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe? for he is ſmall.</hi> Therefore I ſay, look not lightly on theſe relapſes; a Fever is dangerous, but relapſing in it, after ſomething that looks like a Cool, is far more dangerous. Thou that haſt been low, and God hath helped thee out of thy low condition, and made thee to wonder at his goodneſs. Conſider thy poſture, if thou be backſliden, and how much need thou haſt of a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and learn to aggravat that guilt, by thy relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in it.</p>
            <p>But the 3d thing to be marked in this plenteous redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that though it be very uſual in the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to relapſe into ſlavery and bondage; and though it be an hainous fault ſo to do, yet there is in God plenteous redemption, even for that, there is redemption with him for them, who after they have been delivered, have through their folly relapſed into bondage. I ſhall not need to ſtand to prove this any length from Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.43.— <hi>Many times did he deliver them. but they provocked him by their counſel, and were brought low by their iniquity; nevertheleſs he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry, and he remembered for them his Covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies;</hi> there is plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous redemption. And when <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. he hath told them, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that when they had often relapſed, and he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them, and now they had forſaken him, and ſerved other gods, and he would deliver them no more; yet when they inſiſt, and will not quite him, it's added, <hi>v.</hi> 16. that his ſoul was grieved for the miſery of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> their miſery pleaded with him to have compaſſion on them, and deliver them. And <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. <hi>ch.</hi> How many proofs of love are there recorded from <hi>Egypt</hi> all along in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and in the promiſed land, notwithſtanding their
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:47356:246"/>
rebellions, and when he had wrought for them over and over again, and they ſtill relapſed, he was provocked to ſay, he would deſtroy them; yet he tells, that he wrought for his own Names ſake, that it might not be polluted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen; for what-ever they did deſerve, his Name did not deſerve to ſuffer, therefore he wrought for them; and relative to this is that invitation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers,</hi> (not at once, but ſucceſſively, and in the intervals, between deliveries) <hi>yet return again to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt on this, but they that are under convictions of privat and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick relapſes, and of the hazard of relapſes, and cannot tell what to make of them, or what will be the latter end of their running back &amp; back again into bondage after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries, they may encourage themſelves from this, <hi>that with the Lord our God there is plenteous redemption.</hi> And if ye ſay, how, and in what terms may folk that have thus relapſed, look out for this redemption in God. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the direction of faith may come to be ſpoken to in the next Doctrine, and therefore here I ſhall only preſs on them that would look our for redemption. Firſt, That much neglected, and yet moſt neceſſary work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, according to that, which ſome would have a plague, but I think ſounds like a promiſe, <hi>Ezek</hi> 7.16. <hi>They that eſcape of them, ſhall eſcape on the mountains, and ſhall be like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning every one for his iniquity.</hi> O to ſee that frame of ſpirit, to ſee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance more in faſhion among us; God hath made us ſmart many ways, becauſe we would not afflict our ſelves, and yet we will not do it. O! this is an impenitent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pray for repentance. 2. I would have you in the ſtudy of repentance, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>king to the aggravations of ſin, and that from your frequent relapſing in it, that after we have felt the bitterneſs of our folly, we have turned again to it, that we have given up to walk with God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:47356:246"/>
we have ſpoken of much bleſſedneſs in his company, that when we have found the threatnings verified, and promiſes made out to us and to others, yet the byaſs of our hearts is out of courſe, and we will try theſe woful concluſions of new. O! take a look of the dreadful ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations that relapſing in bondage hath with it. 3. As the reſult of all this, I would recommend to you to be in Gods reverence, in reference to that which I ſpoke the laſt day, even his prerogative-royal, in free grace, for any redemption that we can expect. I told you of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting carnal confidences, that folk ſhall not proſper in them, becauſe they would not quite them, and lay their deplorable caſe at the footſtool of Soveraignty in him, and nothing looks with a more dreadful aſpect to right diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, than to ſee the temper of the Jews among us, who (<hi>Jer.</hi> 12.4. when the Land is mourning) ſay, <hi>he ſhall not ſee our last end.</hi> And <hi>Chap</hi> 2.8. <hi>The veſſels of the Lords houſe ſhall come back again:</hi> And there is nothing more hopeful under relapſes, than to be putting off our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, to ſee what God will do with us; to be non-pluſſed under convictions of relapſes, and to be caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves at the Foot-ſtool of Soveraignty in free grace: Were we in that humble poſture, it would ſpeak more ground of hope, than all our carnal confidences, which are made Pillows to ſleep on in our ſecurity. Now I have done with the ſecond main Point, to encourage <hi>Irſael</hi> to <hi>hope in God,</hi> that <hi>with him is plenteous redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to the 3d Obſervation, that at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to theſe words I propoſed to be ſpoken to, That what God is, or what is in God, is put forth by God, for the behove of his people, according as they need it. I gather this from the connexion of the two Verſes, <hi>with God there is merey, and with him there is plenteous redemption;</hi> and what follows? <hi>And he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> If he have mercy to compaſſionat them in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:47356:247"/>
and if he have authority and power to vindicate them from bondage, it ſhall be ſeen in their actual deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. The point is plain and obvious. Gods all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, his furniture for the need of his people ſhall not be wanting, but put forth actually, as he ſees good, for the behove of his people. If he have plenteous redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he ſhall redeem <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his iniquities. Hence it is, that in Scripture we have not only an account of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture in God (if I may ſo word it) for his people, <hi>That with him is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption;</hi> and of promiſes, wherein God engages himſelf to put forth that furniture for their behove; but the Scripture gives an account of his actual putting forth that mercy and power for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.10. There are news to be ſent and publiſh'd in the Iſles afar off, and what is that? <hi>He that ſcattered Iſrael will gather them, and keep him as a ſhepherd doth his flock;</hi> and what more? <hi>For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ranſomed him from the hand of him that was ſtronger than he.</hi> It's ſpoken of as a thing done, and on this account <hi>David</hi> in his Prayer promiſes himſelf a good day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.9. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be joyful in the Lord, it ſhall rejoice in his ſalvation; all my bones ſhall ſay</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me to hear joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoice; who is like unto thee, that delivers the poor from him that is too ſtrong for him; yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoils him?</hi> I am (would he ſay) looking for a Song, when not ſo much as a broken bone ſhall be dumb, but all ſhall get a voice to ſing praiſe for actual redemption. I ſhall not need to ſtand to prove this from the all-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, from his love and affection to his people, and from his fidelity, that cannot lie: Nor will I break in on the particular inferences of this point now: Only in general be not vexed, take it not ill, though ye be put to, and kept at a taſk, to keep a good report in your hearts
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:47356:247"/>
of God, when temptation ſays, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Lord hath caſt off for ever, and will be favourable no more, his mercy is clean gone,</hi> &amp;c. When temptation ſays, what means this and that in my caſe? If all this mercy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption be with God, (and thou may then have a hard ſteek of work to keep up a good report of him, when ſo many Hell Fire-brands are going thick and three-fold.) Be encouraged and comforted in this, that a day comes, when actual redemption ſhall take all theſe off thy hand, and thou ſhalt not have it to ſay only, <hi>That with God is redemption,</hi> in oppoſition to thy troubles, but he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ranſomed him from the hand of him that was ſtronger than he. Be comforted in this, ye that are engaged in a taſk to keep up a good report of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prejudices; The time is coming, when he will leave you little to ſay to his commendation, when he ſhall come and relieve you, and make actual redemption, give the lie to all miſtakes and prejudices whatſoever.</p>

            <p>I Am now, ye ſee, towards the cloſe of this Pſalm, which hath detained me ſo long, upon the account of the riches and univerſal uſefulneſs of the matter therein contained: Ye may remember, that after that Exhortation to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>hope in the Lord,</hi> I came to the motives encouraging them ſo to do; wherein ſomewhat was ſpoken to what is ſupponed concerning the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, called to hope, and allowed to hope in God, that they are under the ſenſe of miſery, needing mercy, and under the ſenſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, needing plenteous redemption, and in particular, under the ſenſe of the bondage of ſin, putting them in need to be redeemed from all their iniquities; and in
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:47356:248"/>
ſpeaking to what is propoſed for the encouragment of ſuch to hope in God: I hinted ſomewhat concerning theſe two great truths, <hi>That with God there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may remember, that I told you, there be two words further to be gathered from this 8. <hi>v.</hi> One is, that what is in or with God, it ſhall be put forth for the behove of his people, as they have need, <hi>he ſhall redeem Iſrael;</hi> and another is, That it's in particular <hi>Iſraels</hi> great mercy, that God ſhall be a Redeemer to him from all his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, I brake in on it on the cloſe of the mornings Exerciſe, that what is in, or with God, ſhall be put forth for the behove of his people as they need it, and they ſhall find it made forth-coming to them as they need it; for if there be <hi>with him plenteous redemption, he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I left at a general word of Uſe from this, That we ſhould not take it ill, to be kept at a taſk of bringing up a good report on God againſt all prejudices, and whatſoever temptation ſuggeſts of him; for the time is coming (which the Lord will haſten in his time) that he will leave us little to ſay to his commendation, his own performances will ſay ſo much, and declare him to be exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe: The time is coming, that they ſhall not think ſhame of it, that (if we may ſo word it) have ſpoken good of him behind his back, and would not take a report of him, but from his Bible.</p>
            <p>But to follow out this a little, for the comfort of them that are looking for the accompliſhment of what is in, or with God, for the behove of his people. I ſhall lead you to a fourfold direction, in order to this, and endeavour to put a cloſe to this Scripture.</p>
            <p>The firſt direction is this, That ye would ſtudy to be well acquaint with the Word, to be well acquaint with
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:47356:248"/>
what God hath declared is in him for his people. The Bible ſhould be a well-finger'd Book in gloomy times. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> knew well what he was doing, when he made the Statutes his ſong in the houſe of his pilgrimage: and the reaſon why I preſs this acquaintance with the Word, is, to help you to prevent a double hazard; there is on the one hand the hazard of ignorance of the Word, when folk know not their wealth contained in their Charter. When folk are like <hi>Hagar,</hi> beſide the Well, and yet like to caſt their <hi>Iſhmael</hi> from them, like to die for thirſt, becauſe their eyes are not open to diſcern it. Ignorance undoes many folk, becauſe they know not their allowance: And another hazard upon the other hand, that by preſſing you to be acquaint with the Scripture, I would have avoided, and that is the hazard of miſtaking and over-reaching, when folks luſts and carnal expectations would make a light and ground of expectation to themſelves, when they look for what God hath not promiſed, or hath not abſolutely promiſed, or not always, theſe are dangerous, we had need to have our expectations well bottomed, leſt a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment founded on a miſtake, make us to miſbelieve that which is really promiſed; a cruſh in a carnal expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation may make us look on the Bible as a poor Cordial in difficulties, we would therefore guard againſt both ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and miſtaking, or over-reaching.</p>
            <p>A 2d Direction is, That when ye have found any thing in the Bible that is uſeful for you, your firſt work would be, to prize the certainty of what is contained there. I ſpoke to this at great length on theſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>In his Word do I hope.</hi> That the Scriptures are the Word of God, of Divine Authority, but I can never enough preſs it; folks that have their Treaſure and Store-houſe in the Bible, prize the Bible, look on it as the word of him that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, as a <hi>tryed word, as ſilver tryed in a furnace of earth, purified ſeven times,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. That many have ventured
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:47356:249"/>
their <hi>all</hi> upon, and never found crack nor ſlaw in, (to ſpeak ſo) and Miniſters had done with their taſk, if the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this truth, that the Scriptures are the Word of God, were believed, and if thou cannot get the Promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, will thou look out on the threatnings, that thou diſcerns to be accompliſh'd, and thou needs not doubt of a promiſe, ſo long as thou haſt a threatning, which thou ſeeſt verified: Ponder that word, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.14, 15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, as I thought to puniſh you when your fathers provocked me to wrath, and I repented not; So again have I thought in thoſe days to do well unto Jeruſalem, and to the houſe of Judah: fear not.</hi> If ye doubt of my promiſes, that are not yet accompliſh'd, take a confirmation of them from my threatnings, which ye found verified.</p>
            <p>A 3d Direction I would give them that are looking for the accompliſhment of what is in, or with God, and he hath promiſed, is, that having found out what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture, and prized it as of infallible verity and certainty, then put to your Faith to it, that <hi>he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquity,</hi> for he hath ſaid it. I cannot give you this Direction more ſuccinctly, than the Lord gives it to <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> who when he had prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Caldeans, Chap.</hi> 1. he is bidden, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.2, to <hi>write the viſion, and make it plain upon tables,</hi> ſpeak it out, conceal it not, <hi>that he that runs may read it. For</hi> v. 3. <hi>the viſion is yet for an appointed time,</hi> it will not come preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it,</hi> there is Faith's work now, <hi>becauſe it will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, it will not tarry.</hi> Ye may remember I ſpoke alſo to this, when I was upon theſe words, <hi>And in his word do I hope.</hi> But in following it out now, I ſhall only touch on three or four words concerning Faith's looking out to what God ſhall do, and make out to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And 1. I would have you looking on Faith as the moſt eminent and honourable of employments, though not the moſt ſenſible
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:47356:249"/>
and ſatisfactory. There is much work my a fall in Saints hand, which may be ſweeter, and may go better with them, but no work is ſo eminent and accceptable to God: So it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. When <hi>Thomas,</hi> after he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced, he was a man that would not believe, without <hi>ſeeing the print of the nails, and thruſting his hand into Chriſts ſide,</hi> he makes a great phraſe, and ſays, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> Well (ſays Chriſt) <hi>Thomas, becauſe thou hast ſeen me, thou haſt believed, but bleſsed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed. Thomas,</hi> ye might have been more acceptably imployed in giving me credite, although ye had not gotten ſenſible ſatisfaction. 2. Another word is, that diſtruſt is the in-let to all folks miſcarriages in a ſtormy time; a man is even as tint as if he were in the Sea bottom, as to any acceptable acquitting of himſelf to God in his work, before his promiſe be accompliſh'd. When ever he is over-power'd with unbelief, then he is ready to ſay, <hi>There is no hope, we will walk every one in the imagination of his own heart.</hi> Ponder that word. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>To whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? So they could not enter in, becauſe of unbelief.</hi> There the thing that held the people out of the promiſed Land, and made them periſh in the Wilderneſs, unbelief: And compare it with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. to 11. Where ye find them <hi>luſters, idolaters, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, tempters of Christ, murmurers.</hi> To tell that, make once folk unbelievers, and ye may make them any of theſe, or all of them upon a ſuitable temptation. There is no ill turn that occurs, but an unbeliever capacitats himſelf for it, if mercy in God prevent it not. And a 3d word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this exerciſe of Faith (and I ſhall add no more) is, that it ſays not a little to the granting or denying of a delivery, to the haſtning, or for-ſlowing of an iſſue, this

exerciſe of faith. If unbelief keep out of the promiſed Land, and make <hi>Iſrael</hi> fall and wander in the Wilderneſs fourty years, as in that <hi>Heb</hi> 3.18. Then bleſſed believing haſtens the performance of the promiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.45. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is ſhe that believed, for there ſhall be a performance of theſe things which was told her from the Lord.</hi> Little knows folk, how God may be provocked to make their unbelief the rule of their allowance, that, when they bod little, they ſhall ſee as little: No, but God may, and often doth ſhame the unbelief of his people, and make their falſe eyes ſee that they were in the wrong to him; but certainly unbelief of its own nature is obſtructive of the performance of promiſes; and if many die in the Wilderneſs, they have as their carnal confidence on the one hand, ſo their unbelief and deſpondency on the other, to blame for it. And I ſhall add more, if unbelief withhold not the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the promiſe, it may have a black iſſue, when the accompliſhment of the promiſe, comes to the man that entertains it. And as to this, I would on the one hand commend to you that Paſſage, to be pondered, concerning that blaſphemous lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. who when <hi>Eliſha</hi> Propheſied of incredible plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſaid, <hi>If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?</hi> It ſhall be, ſaith the Prophet, and <hi>thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but ſhalt not eat thereof,</hi> and it was ſo; he was <hi>a</hi> Grandee, on whoſe hand the King leaned, and thought, if there were any fores to be had, he ſhould have a ſhare; &amp; the King giving him the charge of the Gate, <hi>the people trode upon him, and he died.</hi> And on the other hand, ponder that comfortable Song that believers ſing, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: this is our God, we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi> O, that Saints, would think, that ſuch a turn of providence may come their way, that will make them ſay and ſing, I truſted in him in a ſtrait, when not only he was inviſible (as he is always in himſelf,) but
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:47356:253"/>
wrapt up in a cloud of myſterious diſpenſations; O! that ye would think that ſuch a ſong is poſſible and ſweet; but if that be a ſweet ſong, what bitter youling will it put them to, or may they have, who when God appears, muſt ſay, Lo, there he is, but we waited not for him; ſo ſoon as he went out of our ſight, we tint all hope, we knew not what it was to wait for him, who hid his face from the houſe of <hi>Jacob;</hi> we knew not what it was to bear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, till he ſhould ariſe and plead our cauſe, and execute judgment for us, and believe that he ſhould bring us out to the light, to behold his righteouſneſs; Thus ye ſee what an important matter it is, that we put forth Faith &amp; keep it in exerciſe, for the accompliſhment of what is in &amp; with God, for his people, which is the third Direction.</p>
            <p>A 4th Direction which I give, and leave this Note, and that is, That ye would wiſely conſider what the Lord means, when he puts his people to the exerciſe of their Faith ſo much, about that which he will do. <hi>He will redeem Iſrael from all their iniquities;</hi> and yet he putteth Iſrael to believe it: What means the Lord, I ſay, in holding them at that task of believing: &amp; here, without offering to encroach upon the depth of the wiſdom &amp; knowledge of God, in his Providence, the people of God have ſomewhat to look to without &amp; about them, &amp; ſomewhat to look to within them, if they look to ſomewhat without or about them; God has more ado in the world, than a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſaint, or even a particular Church to ſatisfie; O! the deep contexture of Providence, how unſearchable are his counſels? and his ways paſt finding out; That what is very unſatisfactory to one or one Society, God may have holy ends for it in the world: But to come nearer, What have Believers to look to in the world without them? Take it in that word, which the Lord has to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when he is making the Covenant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. When he has told him, that though his ſeed ſhould go down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet in the fourth generation
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:47356:254"/>
they ſhould come hither again; If <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould ask, Why ſhould they ſtay there ſo long? He anſwers, <hi>The i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity of the Amorites is not yet full;</hi> God holds his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the task of believing; while the enemies cup is a filling, might <hi>I</hi> inſiſt upon this, I might tell you, That the enemies cup is often very long in filling, but long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without the Church, than within the Church; four hundred years to the <hi>Amorites</hi> was long, yet they being a people without the Church, they took all that time to fill their cup; but elſewhere their enemies ripe faſter, their cup is ſooner filled; and I might add, a cup that is long a filling, is ordinarly a very bitter cup, when it is holden to the head of enemies; when the cup of the <hi>Amorites</hi> is full, utter extermination, rooting out, and offcutting comes upon them; Lord ſave them whom folks wiſh well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, from a long friſted plague; a long brewing ſtorm is more dread ſulthan hand payment: And therefore it would not ſtumble folk to ſee wicked men for born, but if it were rightly looked on, every days forbearance would be an argument of pity; for a cup that is long a filling, is moſt bitter, when it is held to the head. But that which <hi>I</hi> am upon is, that the people of God, when they are at the trade of believing, have ſomething to look to without them, and particularly to the cup of enemies that is a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: But again, when they are holden at the task of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, they would alſo look to ſomething within them, and among them; What means it, that God hath given many rich and precious Promiſes to Believers, and yet they get no more in hand, but Faith to believe them, if they can win to that, where are his former loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which he hath ſworn to <hi>David?</hi> For looking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and among you, ponder that word, which ye have, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.12. When the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the glory of his high looks; and compare it with the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:47356:254"/>
Verſes preceeding, there ye will find the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly blaſpheming, he ſays, <hi>Are not my princes altogether Kings, as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whoſe graven images did excel them of Jeruſalem, and of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria: Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, ſo do to Jeruſalem and her idols? What nation hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of my hand, that the God of Iſrael ſhould deliver Jeruſalem out of my hand.</hi> One would think now, were he a God in Heaven, he would ſit no more vvith a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous atheiſt, he vvill ſuffer him no more to blaſpheme and reproach vvith an high contempt of him and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he vvill novv be knovvn by the judgment which he ſhall execute: but at leiſure, he will make himſelf knovvn, but not till he have done his vvhole vvork on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for all the haſte, his work on Mount <hi>Zion</hi> and on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is the greateſt haſte, he will let the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> blaſpheme on, and trode down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, till that be done; his great work is to do good by the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> within his Church, and among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and when his work is done there, he will reckon with him, and be known by the judgment which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes upon him: And if ye ask, what this may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, and among the people of God, that he will have them minding, when he puts them to ſend by Faith on the Promiſes; I dare not offer to give you an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, but only to caſt ſome ground for work to your hand; if ye mind practically to improve ſuch a Doctrine, I ſhal briefly hint at ſome Scriptures, which will give you ſome light in what it is; The firſt is that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15, 16. Wherein the Lord tells, <hi>he led his people through a great and terrible wilderneſs, wherein were fiery ſerpents, and ſcorpions and drought, and brought water to them out of the flint, and fed them with Manna, which their fathers knew not;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? <hi>That he might humble and prove them, to do them good, at their latter end:</hi> Theſe Diſpenſations were humbling and proving, humbling, not cruſhing, for ye will get cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:47356:255"/>
without Prayer, and diſcouragement without pains, but humbling muſt be the product of Prayer and pains; they are not humbled, ſays the Lord, even to this day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.10. Every broken body is not an humbled body; though from pride of heart, they may be irritat, canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cruſht, and to help to this, proving muſt be added, which brings diſcoveries; and folk would try what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, their being put to ſend by Faith, brings forth, and lays before them; proving will often bring butt, that which ye thought was not ther benn (as ye uſe to ſpeak) paſſion, pride, fretting, haſte, a legion of foul evils; and it would bod well, if when folks are put to fend by Faith, amongſt the Promiſes, if they met with ſuch diſcoveries, and ſaw ugly boſſoms, and were bearing about their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and humbled under them: Another Scripture that will hint a word of Direction to you, what your work ſhould be, while put to fend by Faith, is that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings ſhall reprove thee;</hi> know then and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord, &amp;c. This is it I was on in the morning, Repentance, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, O! how abaſing is it, when our wickedneſs and backſliding are ſent to reprove and convert us, not only in keeping up the performance of Promiſes, but in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of threatnings, when God makes all the world vviſe of a peoples vvickedneſs, vvhen he goes, as it vvere, to the ſtreet vvith their faults, vvhen he ſpits in their face, and ſhoots them vvith <hi>Miriam,</hi> without the camp; and it vvere a bleſt vvork, if this led to Repentance. And a 3d piece of vvork <hi>I</hi> vvould recommend to you, is, to ſee if ye can believe indeed, Try if ye have Faith, and a vvell breathed Faith, a biding Faith that will ſett its face to a ſtorm; remember that word that Chriſt hath to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.40. Why are ye ſo fearful, O! ye of little faith? Hovv is it that ye have no Faith? vvhen they in a ſtorm, like to drovvn, and cryed, <hi>Maſter, cares thou not
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:47356:255"/>
that we periſh,</hi> vvhen he has rebuked the vvind and ſea, he gives them this check; There are many, vvho for all the times and exerciſes have paſt over them, have had ſome dreilling and skirmiſhes for Faith, vvhich are preſently diſcuſt; but God may ſee it meet to give them exerciſe for a fight of Faith, to ſee if their Faith be a freſh-weather-Faith, or a Faith that vvill venture on the Deep at his vvord; and look that Chriſt have not that to ſay, <hi>Why are ye ſo fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</hi> He is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his people to believe, vvhen he puts them to live and fend among the Promiſes by Faith. And a 4th word I give you, vvhich I vvill not ſay ſhould be vvritten upon gold Letters, but upon your hearts, vvho vvould fend by Faith amongſt the Promiſes, till the performance come, and it is that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Here is the patience and faith of the ſaints;</hi> Having ſpoken before of ſore troubles, vvhy is Patience put firſt, and then Faith, becauſe many a time Faith may not have a turn to put its hand to, but to vvait for God, and ſee if ye can vvin to that Faith, vvhich vvhen it has not a turn to do, but patiently wait on God, is about that. And a fifth vvord I recommend to you, is that ſpoken of <hi>David, Acts</hi> 13.36. It is ſaid, <hi>After he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, he fell on ſleep;</hi> Whatever may be the particular meaning of the place, it may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken up thus, That <hi>David</hi> took his generation work, as God put it in his hand, he was not a carver or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber, but a ſubmitter to God; if it was a generation vvork, a work commanded by God, and neceſſary for him to be ſtudied; vvhen the people of God are put to fend by Faith amongſt the Promiſes, till performance come, O! what thoughts of heart will they have, were they thus and thus employed, how refreſhful vvould it be to them? but many have no more, but that they are caſt idle, and neceſſitat to ſit idle at Chriſt's feet, and look up to him, and their idleneſs is very unpleaſant to fleſh; But thou vvho art in that poſture, vvould learn
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:47356:256"/>
to believe, thou can never be put out of Work. A godly man can never be an idle man, change his vvork he may, but idle he cannot be, were it but to bear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to want of work, it is work; And O! how ſweet is that, let the ſaint be toſt as a ball in a large place, they are always at work acceptable to God: And then ye would learn to ſee beauty in a generation work, be what it will, that is the knack of it (to ſpeak ſo) the main thing to be noticed. If thou be ſerving thy generation by the will of God, however it be in a work that is unpleaſant to thee, even thy idleſet, thy humbling work, thou ſhould learn to ſee a beauty in it, that thou may lay it on his altar as an acceptable ſervice to him, as if thou were at work more refreſhing to thee. Theſe are ſome few thoughts why the Lord on ſeveral accounts, holds his people at the trade of Faith, and ſends them to fend by Faith among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes till the performance come. I ſhall go no further. <hi>The Lord bleſs his word to you.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Am now drawing towards a cloſe of this Pſalm, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have inſiſted ſo long, upon the account of the conſtant and univerſal uſefulneſs of the ſubject matter therein contianed.</p>
            <p>From the Arguments encouraging Iſrael to hope in God, which is the Exhortation in the 7 <hi>verſe,</hi> from theſe Arguments, I ſay, to preſs and invite to hope in God, I have been marking ſomewhat that is ſuppoſed, that is the caſe of God's Iſrael, who are invited to hope, and allowed to hope in God, that they are under miſery and bondage, and particularly under the bondage of ſin; And I have ſpoken alſo to what is propoſed for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:47356:256"/>
as 1. <hi>That there is mercy with God.</hi> 2. <hi>That with him there is plenteous redemption.</hi> And, 3. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt the ſeventh and eighth Verſes, That what is in God, and with God, for the behove of his people, will undoubtedly be put forth and manifeſted to them, as they ſtand in need of it; for if he have mercy, he ſhall compaſſionat them in their miſery, if <hi>plenteous redemption be with him, He ſhall redeem Iſrael from all their iniquities;</hi> If he have authority and power to redeem, it ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be evinced in actual redeeming of them.</p>
            <p>Now there remains a 4th Obſervation to be ſpoken to, That it is the great and peculiar ground of hope and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to God's Iſrael, that <hi>he will redeem them from all their iniquities,</hi> which is the very words of the Text, <hi>He ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities;</hi> Therefore <hi>let Iſrael hope in the Lord;</hi> This Point though it be rich and full in it ſelf, yet I may be the more brief in the handling of it; That on the 4th Verſe I ſpoke at great length to that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning forgiveneſs of ſins; I ſhall therefore here firſt Explain the Point a little, as it is held out in the Text, and then ſpeak to ſome Inferences and Uſes from it.</p>
            <p>What we ſay in Explication of the Point, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to 4 Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally ye would conſider, That it is a great encouragement to God's people, that guilt, ſin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, needs not mar their hope in God; for though Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael have ſinned, and though their ſins here be called ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and though there be an all of theſe iniquities, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that, the Spirit of God makes it here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, Iſrael may hope in God, for <hi>He ſhall redeem them from all their iniquities.</hi> By the Covenant of Works, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity getting once place, all hope is forefault, that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain being once broken, it is everlaſtingly, and irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably broken: But here is the Goſpels glad news, and great encouragement, That iniquities, if folks be ſeeking redemption from them, needs not hinder hope in God;
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:47356:257"/>
That when as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20 <hi>By the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight;</hi> For by the law is the knowledge of ſin; That Verſe 21. There is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God without the Law manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets, that affords ground of hope, that when Iſrael hath treſpaſſed againſt God, <hi>Yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing, Ezra</hi> 10.2. In a word, theſe are no ſmall part of the glad news of the Goſpel, That there is any tryſting betwixt God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, That every ſtep in guilt, is not a ſtep into utter deſpair, That man upon every failing, has not done ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly with any ground of hope to the ſight of God's face in favour. That's the firſt, and chief part of the glad news of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider what it is that God does in reference to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which gives ground of hope to Iſrael; <hi>He redeems from iniquity.</hi> Now as ye heard from Verſe 4. There is in iniquity theſe two, The guilt, or offence done to God, and the obligation to puniſhment reſulting thereon. And there is the dominion power and tyranny of ſin, which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exciſes over the ſinner, where it once gets acceſs; Now redemption from both theſe is the work of God by Chriſt, He redeems from the guilt of ſin, by the price and merit of his death, by that infinite, compleat and ſufficient ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom which he hath payed to Juſtice, to appeaſe the wrath of God, and to reſtore the guilty ſinner to favour with him, and he redeems from the dominion, power and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of ſin, by the power and vertue of his death; and to this may be applyed, that of <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</hi> He gave himſelf for us, not only by his death, to expiat the guilt of ſin, but that he might break the bonds of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make us a purified and peculiar people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, zealous of good works. I ſhall not need here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat the <hi>Socinians</hi> cavillations, who from this phraſe of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:47356:257"/>
redeeming from iniquity, would obſcure the truth of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, as if the term Redemption did not import a ſatisfaction, or paying of a price, for, ſay they, <hi>We are redeemed from the iniquity and power of Satan, to whom no ſatisfaction is payed.</hi> But that is but a miſtake of the import of the phraſe; for as it is ſpoken of in reference to God, it imports conſtantly a ranſom, as <hi>Job.</hi> 33.24. <hi>Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ranſom;</hi> and, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> but when it is ſpoken in reference to ſin or Sathan, it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken, and is a redemption by force, as if a perſon arreſted for debt in priſon, when the principal Creditor were ſatisfied, his Cautioner ſhould break the fetters, that is redemption from ſin; and as if he ſhould deliver him from the Jaylor, by giving him a broken Head, that's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Sathan.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ye would conſider the univerſality of this Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and this is alſo in the Text, <hi>He ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities,</hi> holding forth the univerſal extent of their Redemption, which for your better underſtanding ye ſhall ſhortly take up under theſe three, 1. <hi>He redeems his people from the guilt of all their ſins;</hi> for as on the one hand, there is no ſin ſo little that God will paſs over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſatisfaction; There is no venial ſin that needs not a ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and that merits not condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> even eternal death, which is oppoſed there to eternal life, the gift of God; So on the other hand, no ſins of his people are ſo hainous, though they be iniquities, as in the Text, though they be ſcarlet and crimſon coloured ſins, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.18. But if God in Chriſt be made uſe of, they ſhall be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, <hi>He will blot out as a thick cloud their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and as a cloud their ſins,</hi> when they return to him, for he hath redeemed them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.22. So he will redeem them from the guilt of all their iniquities. 2. This univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>all</hi> may be underſtood in relation to the power of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:47356:258"/>
iniquity, that where he falls in on the ſinner, he redeems from the bondage and ſlavery of all ſin, and when that work is rightly undertaken in his ſtrength, the ſinner is a ſlave to no iniquity, he balks none, he ſpares no <hi>Zoar,</hi> no <hi>Delila,</hi> no darling ſin, when he comes to redeem and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the iniquities of his people, all that is iniquity, he puts them to take it to task, to have a reſpect to all his commands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>And to eſteem all his precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all things to be right, and to hate every falſe way; verſe</hi> 128. A ſtudy of univerſal Mortification is that which he puts them on to, when he will redeem from iniquity. And 3. The univerſal <hi>all</hi> may be extended yet further, even to all the degrees of iniquity, that not only doth he redeem his people from the guilt, and from the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of all ſin, but he ſets them on work to purge out all ſin, and in due time he will redeem them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and remainders of ſin; every thing that hath the relique or remainder of iniquity in it, he will redeem them from it in due time.</p>
            <p>And 4. Ye would conſider the object of this mercy, who they are that he will redeem from all iniquity, they are his people Iſrael, the object of God's power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in redeeming, in his being a propitiation for ſin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming from the power and guilt of ſin, are Iſrael, and they only; That as <hi>Adam</hi> when he fell, drew all his ſeed along into perdition with himſelf: So Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> will redeem all his ſeed, which is the true import of that compariſon, inſtitute betwixt the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſecond, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and not to prove an univerſal redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, for then as all fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo all ſhould be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally redeemed and liberat by Chriſt; but the meaning is, That as in <hi>Adam,</hi> all his ſeed fell with him, ſo by Chriſt all his ſeed are redeemed; and as in <hi>Adam</hi> all fell not, Chriſt was excepted, ſo by Chriſt all are not redeemed, his ſeed only are recovered. This is a Point <hi>I</hi> need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to debate. It is too evident, many are not redeemed by
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:47356:258"/>
Chriſt, for many have not the outward means, that make offer of redemption by Chriſt, many never heard tell of Chriſt, and if Chriſt had payed a price for all, it were not agreeable to Juſtice, that ſo many ſhould be put to ſuffer puniſhment in hell. It is clear alſo from that, that Chriſt <hi>would not pray for the world, Joh.</hi> 17.9. And he did not die for them for whom he would not pray; and he doth not ſanctifie himſelf for all, therefore he redeems not all; and yet this needs be no impediment to them to look to him for Redemption, who find their need of him, their fleeing to him for refuge, and gripping to him for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, opens up the council of God, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the given ones to be redeemed by Chriſt; only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as none of God's Iſrael are ſecluded from this redemption, how worthleſs ſoever they be, Though they may be ſecluded from theſe gifts and meaſures of graces afforded to others, yet not from this redemption, <hi>from all iniquity;</hi> That is the common-good of all, that's <hi>the nail faſtned in the ſure place,</hi> on which all the veſſels of greater and ſmaller quantity are hung; ſo on the other hand, it is to Iſrael alone, and to none other that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is enſured.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained the Point, it remains, That we ſhould draw ſome Uſes from it, and put a cloſe to the Pſalm, and there are four or five words of inference that I would give you from what hath been ſaid. 1. See here what is the great concerning buſineſs, the chief Intereſt and exerciſe of the true Iſrael of God, It is the matter of iniquity, what to do with it, how to be rid of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it; therefore after all the former encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to hope in God, That <hi>with him is mercy,</hi> and <hi>with him is plenteous redemption,</hi> this comes in as the reſerve, that he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his Iniquities; To tell, that the great exerciſe of a true Iſraelite, will be about i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity; the conſcience of ſin and guilt, what to do with that, how to get the conſcience pacified, in reference to
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:47356:259"/>
it; this exerciſe is a great ſtranger in the viſible Church, there may be much trouble of mind, where the conſcience is dormient and ſleeping. There may be much vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie about trouble and croſs diſpenſations of providence, when guilt is little minded, but ye would look to it: I ſhall not ſay they are not <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that fall into this error; but ſurely it looks not like a true <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> where ſin is not made the main exerciſe; where daily ſearching out of ſin, and endeavours to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience purified and purged from guilt, is not folks great taſk. And I ſhall add, that exerciſe about ſin and guilt, would give a more comfortable account about trouble. If we were ſtudying to have this Text made out to us, <hi>He ſhall redeem Iſrael out of all his iniquities,</hi> we ſhould find that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Redeem Iſrael, O God, out of all his troubles,</hi> alſo made out to us; redemption from iniquity would bod well, were a good prognoſtick of redemption from trouble; for as ye heard from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.12. Trouble hath a work on Mount <hi>Zion;</hi> and if ye would know what that is, ſee 27.9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin, when he maketh all the ſtones of the Altar as chalk ſtones,</hi> &amp;c. Were trouble getting its work, it ſhould have the leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do when it had gotten its errand; and therefore ye that are faſht and vexed folks with the Croſs, toſt with many troubles, ſhall I ſay to you, that ye run long on little ground, and to little purpoſe; if ye had more ado about ſin, ye ſhould have leſs ado about trouble, or your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe about it ſhould ſoon be diſcuſt: Therefore look on it as a mark of a true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> that whatever exerciſe he have, ſin is the greateſt exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas folk may ſeem to have ſome exerciſe about ſin, but all that it amounts to, is, to take with ſin, and grip to pardoning mercy; and this is very common in the viſible Church, to name ſin, and to name pardon; and
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:47356:259"/>
upon the naming of ſin, to make a preſent Plaiſter of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and there is an end. To obviat this miſtake, take this word, That the pardon of ſin, and purging out of ſin, muſt go together hand in hand: But in this miſtake me not, I would hurt none, nor have I commiſſion to hurt any. Ye may remember, that when I was on the 4th <hi>Verſe,</hi> I told you, that the filthineſs of ſin remains after the pardon of ſin; but remember alſo, that I then told you, God ſtrikes at the guilt and power of ſin both at once, that where Chriſt comes with the merit of his death, he comes alſo with the power of his death, he lays the Axe to the root of the Tree; but I would not be miſtaken in this either, the pardoned ſinner gets not the power of ſin preſently ſubdued; yea, when he is pardoned, the power of ſin may faſh him more than before, and when ſin is in the dead-throws, it may vex him moſt with ſtrugling. Many a ſad bout may pardoned ſinners have alongſt their life, with their predominants; but where-ever God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſin, he ſets folks to be in necks with ſin, and to have the dominion and power of ſin ſubdued, that ſin reign not in their mortal bodies, they and ſin will not dwell in peace in one houſe, they will not be taken alive captive without a ſcart; they oppoſe it, and proteſt againſt the prevailing of it, they ſin not with full conſent: And O! but this is needful, to have the renovation of the Diſpoſition, to be a Seal of the pardon of ſin; that when thou haſt gripped pardon, thou may know by this that thou art not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe it ſends thee back to get ſin ſubdued and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, with greater eagerneſs and benſil of ſpirit, that if the pardon of ſin take not away the filthineſs of ſin, yet it ſets thee in a ſtated war with it, and oppoſition unto it, that thou and it ſhall never be friends, and God then evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences the pardoning of thy ſin, when he helps thee to ſubdue ſin: And it is no wonder that folk have a cold Coal to blow at, when they are under a temptation, that
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:47356:260"/>
they are not pardoned, and have nothing to witneſs, that they have any thing like the renovation of their diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though in that caſe God forbid that I ſhould forbid ſuch to run to Chriſt for pardon, but in running to him for pardon of ſin, through the merit of his death, and in grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to pardon, carry alongſt the vertue of his death, for the ſubduing of ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This leads me to a 3d word of Inference; many of you may ſay ye are put to a hard taſk, when ye are put ſeek redemption from iniquity, from the power of ſin, as well as from the guilt of ſin: And I grant, it is a hard taſk indeed, and they that eſſay it in earneſt, will find it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable taſk. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots?</hi> Then may they alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do evil; Twin them of their life, as ſoon as twin them of their <hi>Delilah;</hi> or take their darling-ſin out of their boſome, What ſhall they then do with it? This point tells, that God can and will <hi>redeem Iſrael from all their iniquities.</hi> I would in order to this, have you look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two ways on Gods interpoſing to ſubdue iniquity; one is, that ye would never look on the ſubjugation or ſubduing of ſin as leill come, wherein ye are not put to employ God. There be many evils that ye are not tempted to, or if tempted to them, ye get them eaſily under foot, ye are never ſent to God to ſubdue them. Ye have reaſon to ſuſpect ye have never been tryed enough with theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; if in earneſt ye be tried with evils, ye will be ſent to God for the mortification of them, otherwiſe any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification ye get of ills without him, it will fail you when ye have moſt ado with it, and ye will find that Satan is not caſt out, but gone out, and will return and ſurpriſe you, for ye muſt be put to God, for a right redemption from iniquity. And 2. on the other hand, I would have you looking on no iniquity, even that which moſt enſlaves you, as on an iniquity that he cannot ſubdue, or were not
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:47356:260"/>
willing to ſubdue, if he were ſeriouſly employed; ye have his word for it, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. where when he hath ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>He is a God that pardons iniquity, and paſſes by tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He adds, <hi>v.</hi> 19. that <hi>he will have compaſſion, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our iniquities.</hi> He can break in pieces the Gates of Braſs, and cut in ſunder the bars of Iron: (To allude to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.16. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.29.) He can burſt all theſe bonds under which a ſinner is ſhut up in ſlavery and ſervitude, and deliver him from thoſe baſe luſts that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him captive, and held him in bondage. How deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was <hi>Paul</hi> engaged in perſecution? How mad was he in purſuance of that woful Trade? Yet when God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, he made him ſtand unholden. What Monſters were theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8, 9. <hi>Fornicators, idolaters, adulterous, thieves, covetous, drunkards, effeminat,</hi> &amp;c. Yet <hi>v.</hi> 11. he tells them, <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are justified, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the spirit of our God.</hi> As upon the one hand, I would not only have theſe that are puddled with their corruptions, that all their purpoſes and reſolutions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form miſgive them, looking upon it as a cauſe of their ill ſucceſs, that Chriſt is little employed, but alſo I would have them looking on no prevailing predominant evil, as impoſſible to his power to ſubdue it; So on the other hand, O that this might ſpeak a word to profligat profane perſons, that cannot ſleep except they do ill, that cannot go to bed unleſs they be full as beaſts, that rake the life from them rather than twin them and their luſts; they are ſo habituat to exceſs and riot, they cannot forbear it; Thinks thou that an excuſe, that thou cannot help it? What an excuſe would it be for a Thief arraigned at the Bar to ſay, he muſt be forgiven, for he cannot hold up his hands? No more will it excuſe thee for drunkenneſs, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſay, Thou cannot help it, it's an aggravation of thy crime, and no excuſe. But here I
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:47356:261"/>
would leave it at the door of all profligat wretches, as a witneſs againſt them, that God is able to redeem from all theſe iniquities, if they will come to him, God is able to caſt out all theſe Devils that enſlave thee: That deaf De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that will not let thee hear what God ſpeaks to thee; That dumb Devil, that will not ſuffer thee to pray to him; That filthy ſwiniſh Devil, that will never ſuffer thee to be out of the mire of ſome abomination. I here leave it, I ſay, at the door of ſuch Monſters, that there is power in God, if they will employ him, to redeem them from all their iniquities: But here it ſticks, the power of God is little employed to redeem from the power of ſin, becauſe the Conſcience is little touched with the guilt of ſin. O! pray to God, that your Conſeiences may be awak'd, that ye may cry, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> That ſin may be a burden to you, as it will be when the Conſcience is touched; and if ye will not pray, know that God can do that when you little dream of it, as ye may ſee in <hi>Cain, Judas, Achitophel,</hi> who could not keep their Conſciences aſleep; to tell, that folk have not Conſciences at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but if the Conſcience be touch'd with guilt, know there is power in God to redeem from iniquities.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth word of Inference is, That if God (as ye heard in the Explication) do redeem from all iniquities, then not only muſt ye endeavour the pardon of ſin, and the mortification of ſin, but that the mortification of ſin be univerſal, ye muſt ſpare a <hi>Zoar,</hi> a <hi>Delilah,</hi> a boſom ſin or idol, but ſeek that all ſin may be ſubdued, the man that is rightly engaged againſt ſin, it will not ſatisfie him that he hath got the wings of ſin clipped, and made it to couch, that it break not out, but he muſt be at war with it, ſo long as there is a tapoun of ſin (as ye uſe to ſpeak) under ground: it muſt be his exerciſe to be about the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin, till he be quit of ſin altogether; <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:47356:261"/>
from all iniquity</hi> imports, That the remainder of ſin will be a burden, as was it to <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. And made him cry out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> and here is the task and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the truly godly, it will not content them, though ſin do not reign, but the remainder of ſin, the bird-lime of ſin, the clog of corruption will be a burden to them; and theſe who in their ſecurity do ſatisfie themſelves, to get ſin kept under the hatches, they provock God to write what is in their boſom, in their practice, and when any thing breaks out in a perſon that hath the name of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is an evidence they have not been buſie within doors, elſe he needed not to have that Bell rung to him, to give him warning of it.</p>
            <p>And hence 5. If the very remainders and ſeeds of ſin be a burden to the Iſrael of God, till they get home, ye may gather how much thoſe who are true Iſraelites, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with the guilt and power of ſin, will be taken up with the thoughts of a compleat liberation from ſin, with that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our bodies.</hi> And Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. Bids <hi>look up, and lift up our heads, for the day of our redemption draws near;</hi> This is it an Iſraelite indeed is taken up with. There are many folk who when they are vext in the world, would be gone, wherein they look rather to the ills they would flee from, than the good they look for. But here is the exerciſe of a true Iſraelite, they long to be home, that they may be compleatly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from all iniquity; that they may ſin no more, that as it is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. <hi>They may be preſented a glorious bride unto Chriſt not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but may be holy and without blemiſh;</hi> and they that are vext here with the ſtirring, and foul-ſticking ſlime of their corruptions, would be taking a <hi>Piſgah</hi> look of that day
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:47356:262"/>
that is coming, when they ſhall be Redeemed from all Iniquity, from the leaſt degree and grain of it, and ſhall be made perfectly holy. We ſhall ſay no more, but Lord bleſs what ye have heard.</p>
